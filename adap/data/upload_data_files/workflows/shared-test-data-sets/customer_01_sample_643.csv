ABSTRACT. We propose a new reinforcement learning algorithm for partially observable Markov decision processes (POMDP) based on spectral decomposition methods. While spectral methods have been previously employed for consistent learning of (passive) latent variable models such as hidden Markov models, POMDPs are more challenging since the learner interacts with the environment and possibly changes the future observations in the process. We devise a learning algorithm running through episodes, in each episode we employ spectral techniques to learn the POMDP parameters from a trajectory generated by a fixed policy. At the end of the episode, an optimization oracle returns the optimal memoryless planning policy which maximizes the expected reward based on the estimated POMDP model. We prove an order-optimal regret bound with respect to the optimal memoryless policy and efficient scaling with respect to the dimensionality of observation and action spaces.",2.10.4 Reinforcement Learning of POMDPs using Spectral Methods,b7c9b6fe5c4e6994218568eea8c86419d2ced4f1,Partially Observable Markov Decision Processes,https://vimeo.com/173509514

Matthijs T. J. Spaan,"Crowd-sourcing labor markets (e.g., Amazon Mechanical Turk) are booming, because they enable rapid construction of complex workflows that seamlessly mix human computation with computer automation. Example applications range from photo tagging to audio-visual transcription and interlingual translation. Similarly, workflows on citizen science sites (e.g. GalaxyZoo) have allowed ordinary people to pool their effort and make interesting discoveries. Unfortunately, constructing a good workflow is difficult, because the quality of the work performed by humans is highly variable. Typically, a task designer will experiment with several alternative workflows to accomplish a task, varying the amount of redundant labor, until she devises a control strategy that delivers acceptable performance.

Fortunately, this control challenge can often be formulated as an automated planning problem ripe for algorithms from the probabilistic planning and reinforcement learning literature. I describe our recent work on the decision-theoretic control of crowd sourcing and suggest open problems for future research. In particular, I discuss:

The use of partially-observable Markov decision Processes (POMDPs) to control voting on binary-choice questions and iterative improvement workflows.
Decision-theoretic methods that dynamically switch between alternative workflows in a way that improves on traditional (static) A-B testing.
A novel workflow for crowdsourcing the construction of a taxonomy ‚Äî a challenging problem since it demands a global perspective of the input data when no one worker sees more than a tiny fraction.
Methods for optimizing the acquisition of labeled training data for use in machine learning applications; this an important special case, since data annotation is often crowd-sourced.

Ali Akbar Khansir,"As a field of study, English as a Lingua Franca (ELF) saw a meteoric rise during the first decade of the 2000s ‚Äì ELF publications were frequent, a new ELF journal emerged, a yearly international conference took root, Masters programmes were launched, websites arose in their dozens. And then, a year or two ago, the momentum seemed to have come to a halt. The message, much lauded and much needed, was becoming rather repetitive.

This panel analysed the historical trajectory of ELF and discussed its impact across Applied Linguistics, examined its current inertia, and considered how the field might move forward by arguing for the necessity to embrace some of the earliest themes in ELF research ‚Äì themes which have become lost in the pursuit of pedagogy-dominated debates about the role of ELF in the classroom ‚Äì whilst also considering and discussing the impacts of ELF on English language teaching and teacher training. Alan Firth (Newcastle University) is an internationally renowned scholar in the fields of ELF and Applied Linguistics. Andy Harris and Huw Bell (MMU) are researchers and lecturers in Applied Linguistics and English Language Teaching in the Department of Languages, Information and Communications.",Multilingual Life - Where Now for English as a Lingua Franca?,c135d60f8aabf8ef273d9b0ece8b018eb73b4e9b,Applied Linguistics and English Language Teaching,https://vimeo.com/126124113

""Without music, life would be a mistake"" is a quote by the famous German philosopher Friedrich Nietzsche. I truly live a charmed life as a extremely busy music photographer working his arse off in the best rock'n'roll town in the Southern Hemisphere, Melbourne in Australia. I am lucky and very privileged to get to watch up close, listen and experience popular international touring bands, local acts and up and coming bands and singers. I might be photographing over ten gigs in one week or attending multiple music festivals and seeing countless acts perform their special magic on stage. 

It has been many years now of doing this and I must admit that I have become jaded. I have starting thinking, ""yeah, I have heard that all before"", ""that band really reminds me of that other band"" and you loose that spark, that special thrill of seeing and experiencing exciting music. 

Every now and then, I see and band that I know nothing about that completely leave me jaw on the floor....gobsmacked! Most recently this band from BrisVegas called HITS fit that bill perfectly. They are the best band to come from up north since The Saints, in my book. To me it is all about the songs. You can have the flashy presented stage act, you can rock out your cock out or jam out with your clam out all you want BUT if you don't have the songs that resonate with me, I will not be putting you up upon that pedestal, where I will worship you. 

Teenage Mothers is one of those bands! It was The Last Ride At Pony - a 24 hour musical marathon of the last day of legendary dive bar, The Pony Bar. I don't remember how many bands played on that last day but I was there from go to whoa but ONLY ONE BAND stuck in my mind! Teenage Mothers came on stage around 3 or 4am and blasted one great song after another! I couldn't believe what the fuck I was hearing. IT WAS SUBLIME! ""Throw Me Away Like A Rag"", ""I Hate New York"", ""I Don't Wanna Play The Game"" and ""Orlando and Miranda"". Each song was better than the one before, with such catchy hooks and performed with such intensity. FUCK AUSSIE HIP HOP....THIS IS THE SHIT! Why isn't this being played on RAGE or blasted over the radio? Where is hell did this band come from and why have I never heard of them before?

At that time, they had only released an EP. Produced and mixed by none other than Jim Sclavunos of Nick Cave & the Bad Seeds and Grinderman fame. It has taken a long time for the Teenage Mothers debut album to finally get released. Media has been very negative against the band. They are brats, ''huff nangs'', kicked off tours and punch ups! Really I don't give a shit about any of that crap. Here is band that I truly love with a ripper set of songs. END OF STORY! As my friend Jim Murray screamed before they played their set tonight, ""KICK OUT THE NANGS MUDDAHFUCKERS!"" Grab their debut album called ""I Wish I Was Beautiful"". BUY IT, PLAY IT LOUD AND CRANK IT UP OFTEN! I am declaring it now.

Dr. Scott Tanner (DVS Sciences)

Dr. Tanner received his PhD in physical chemistry from York University in Toronto, where he studied the chemistry and kinetics of ion-molecule reactions as they relate to the formation of soot in flames. He joined Sciex, then a small innovative private mass spectrometry company, in 1980 and stayed for 25 years, eventually becoming Principal Scientist. By the early 1990's he had gained an international reputation for his understanding of the fundamentals of Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass Spectrometry, including both plasma processes and ion optics. With the commercial success of the ICP-MS products that he helped to develop and bring to the market through the PerkinElmer-Sciex Joint Venture, Scott had the great fortune to meet and entice Vladimir Baranov and Dmitry Bandura to join his elemental mass spectrometry research group. The team went on to develop and promote the Dynamic Reaction Cell¬Æ which remains, more than a decade later, at the pinnacle of quadrupole ICP-MS technology.

Chris Busby interviewed by Sigyn Meder, Iraq Solidarity Sweden.

The Cause of Congenital Anomaly and Cancer in Fallujah Iraq is Identified As Enriched Uranium From Novel Weapons Systems Deployed by the US.

Remarkably high levels of congenital anomaly at birth, together with high cancer rates in Fallujah, Iraq were previously found in a joint UK Iraqi epidemiological study published in the International Journal of Environment and Public Health in July 2010 and reported in The Independent. The illnesses and unusual changes in the sex-ratio at birth, were shown to appear following the US-led attacks on the town in 2004.
http://www.conflictandhealth.com/content/5/1/15
‚Ä®Many believed that Depleted Uranium weapons were employed but no evidence of this was available. USA forces denied using DU. Now, one year after this, the authors have nailed down the cause of the genetic and genomic effects found in Fallujah. Samira Alaani and Muhammed Tafash, two paediatricians at Fallujah General Hospital, Chris Busby, Visiting Professor at the University of Ulster, Malak Hamdan, a chemical engineer and Eleonore Blaurock Busch, whose laboratory in Germany carried out analytical work has been published in the peer-reviewed journal Conflict and Health the results of an exhaustive study of contamination in Fallujah. They began by analysing the hair of 25 parents of children with congenital malformations using highly sensitive Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass Spectrometry (ICPMS).‚Ä®‚Ä®Metal contamination is excreted into hair at same rate as it is excreted into urine. There were high values of Calcium, Magnesium, Strontium, Aluminium, Bismuth, Mercury and Uranium. However, of these only Uranium, which is radioactive, is associated with cancer and birth defects

Flera forskare anser nu att skadorna i staden beror p√• bruket av vapen med anrikat uran som ska ha anv√§nts av USA mot Fal luja √•r 2004.

ABSTRACT: Tag clouds have proliferated over the web over the last decade. They provide a visual summary of a collection of texts by visually depicting the tag frequency by font size. In use, tag clouds can evolve as the associated data source changes over time. Interesting discussions around tag clouds often include a series of tag clouds and consider how they evolve over time. However, since tag clouds do not explicitly represent trends or support comparisons, the cognitive demands placed on the person for perceiving trends in multiple tag clouds are high. In this paper, we introduce SparkClouds, which integrate sparklines [23] into a tag cloud to convey trends between multiple tag clouds. We present results from a controlled study that compares SparkClouds with two traditional trend visualizations‚Äîmultiple line graphs and stacked bar charts‚Äîas well as Parallel Tag Clouds [4]. Results show that SparkClouds ability to show trends compares favourably to the alternative visualizations.",SparkClouds: Visualizing Trends in Tag Clouds,2a9fdd7f8ba315135c16335e19751c655ff09f1b,SparkClouds: Visualizing Trends in Tag Clouds,https://vimeo.com/76070364

Abstract: The creation of interactive visualization to analyze text documents has gained an impressive momentum in recent years. This is not surprising in the light of massive and still increasing amounts of available digitized texts. Websites, social media, news wire, and digital libraries are just few examples of the diverse text sources whose visual analysis and exploration offers new opportunities to effectively mine and manage the information and knowledge hidden within them. A popular visualization method for large text collections is to represent each document by a glyph in 2D space. These landscapes can be the result of optimizing pairwise distances in 2D to represent document similarities, or they are provided directly as meta data, such as geo-locations. For well-defined information needs, suitable interaction methods are available for these spatializations. However, free exploration and navigation on a level of abstraction between a labeled document spatialization and reading single documents is largely unsupported. As a result, vital foraging steps for task-tailored actions, such as selecting subgroups of documents for detailed inspection, or subsequent sense-making steps are hampered. To fill in this gap, we propose DocuCompass, a focus+context approach based on the lens metaphor. It comprises multiple methods to characterize local groups of documents, and to efficiently guide exploration based on users' requirements. DocuCompass thus allows for effective interactive exploration of document landscapes without disrupting the mental map of users by changing the layout itself. We discuss the suitability of multiple navigation and characterization methods for different spatializations and texts. Finally, we provide insights generated through user feedback and discuss the effectiveness of our approach.

Xianda Zhou,"Generating emotional language is a key step towards building empathetic natural language processing agents. How-ever, a major challenge for this line of research is the lack of large-scale labeled training data, and previous studies are limited to only small sets of human annotated sentiment labels. Additionally, explicitly controlling the emotion and sentiment of generated text is also difficult. In this paper, we take a more radical approach: we exploit the idea of leveraging Twitter data that are naturally labeled with emojis. We collect a large corpus of Twitter conversations that include emojis in the response and assume the emojis convey the underlying emotions of the sentence. We inves-tigate several conditional variational autoencoders training on these conversations, which allow us to use emojis to control the emotion of the generated text. Experimentally, we show in our quantitative and qualitative analyses that the proposed models can successfully generate high-quality abstractive conversation responses in accordance with designated emotions.",MojiTalk: Generating Emotional Responses at Scale,f7eda71e2c88cef614a68a816b4ff186f41762b9,MojiTalk: Generating Emotional Responses at Scale,https://vimeo.com/285802339

This new ‚Äúchoreographic machine‚Äù by Liz Santoro and Pierre Godard broadens research into the link between movement and text by drawing on the musicality of syntax. In search of another relay between text and movement [1], For Claude Shannon uses grammatical dependencies between words in a statement from computer science pioneer Claude Elwood Shannon [2] to recover a linguistic structure that, in turn, generates inexhaustible possibilities for choreographic sequences. Twenty-four discreet movement ‚Äúatoms‚Äù for arms and legs serve as a movement lexicon from which a fixed number of inputs is randomly chosen each time the piece is performed. For each performance, four dancers must assemble and learn one particular choreographic outcome among the billions possible that cannot be rehearsed. They rely on the intimacy they have acquired with the fixed linguistic structure of the text and the intimacy they have acquired with one another. Engaging the resources of both their working and long-term memory, uncovering to the audience the pronouncement of the unknown, concealing the predicaments of entropy, they relentlessly switch circuits. Organized by Matthew Lyons as part of ‚ÄúFrom Minimalism into Algorithm.‚Äù

This talk describes experimental progress toward controlling quantum mechanical coherence and entanglement in a solid-state environment. After describing what coherence and entanglement are, I will explain why using these attributes of the quantum world might be useful for information processing. I will then report from the experimental front lines, describing two approaches to this challenging problem: using electron spin as a quantum bit, and realizing nonabelian excitations in the fractional quantum Hall effect.

Error-correcting codes are an essential feature in all modern forms of digital communication. They are used to protect classical information ‚Äî zeros and ones ‚Äî from the inevitable noise that happens in any physical device. A quantum error-correcting code can protect *quantum* information from noise, and allows us to protect arbitrary quantum wave functions from the jitter of the microscopic world. Recent research has highlighted deep connections between quantum codes and cutting-edge problems in many-body physics. In this talk, I will highlight several examples of how quantum codes can be used as a lens that provides a novel viewpoint on exotic physics. I will show how quantum codes are at the heart of topological phases of matter such as arise in the fractional quantum Hall effect and yield concrete models for the holographic principle in quantum gravity. Finally, I will show how the quest to build quantum codes with optimal error-correcting properties might lead to the strangest state of matter of all: quantum phases of matter where thermal relaxation alone is enough to protect quantum information.",Dr Steven Flammia - The Physics of Quantum Error-Correcting Codes,090c8dabd4dfc407a9919af04ad839aefff7d714,The fractional quantum Hall effect.,https://vimeo.com/131513492

Researchers who corrected a scientific paper claiming social conservatives are associated with psychoticism‚Äîwhen it was in fact liberals‚Äîare calling the correction ‚Äúquite minor.‚Äù

The correction came three years after the paper claimed social liberals were linked with ‚ÄúSocial Desirability,‚Äù and conservatives with authoritarianism.

The paper ‚ÄúCorrelation not Causation: The Relationship Between Personality Traits and Political Ideologies‚Äù was released in October 2013. The researchers admitted the results were ‚Äúexactly reversed,‚Äù in a correction in January, which was first reported by Power Line Blog.

How Liberals Distort The English Language to Deceive and Manipulate

One of the best examples of how liberals distort the English language to deceive can be found in what they call themselves: ‚Äúprogressives.‚Äù If the American left is progressive, then what is progress? Is bankrupting the American economy progress? Is using government entitlements to garner political support progress? Is encouraging an entitlement mentality progress? Is promoting a victim mentality progress? Is perpetuating racial strife progress? Is transforming America‚Äôs public schools and colleges into leftist indoctrination centers progress? If these things are considered progress, then the left is certainly progressive. But if these are seen for what they really are, the left should stop calling itself progressive and start calling itself destructive.

Cynthia Rosenzweig,"Discovering ways to help vulnerable ecosystems adapt to impacts of climate change
Patrick Gonzalez, U.S. National Park Service

Emissions from motor vehicles, power plants, deforestation, and other human sources are changing global climate and damaging ecosystems and human well-being.  Field observations from around the world have detected significant changes in ecosystems and attributed them to climate change rather than other factors. Climate change has shifted ranges of plants, animals, and biomes, altered the timing of life events such as plant flowering and animal migration, increased wildfires, and driven some amphibian species to extinction. Further warming may overwhelm the adaptive capacity of many species and ecosystems.

Climate change poses a fundamental problem for natural resource management: climate patterns are shifting in space and time, but national parks, national forests, and other natural areas remain at fixed locations. Three particular types of scientific research advance development of measures to help species and ecosystems adapt. First, quantification of emissions reductions from energy conservation and efficiency and reduced deforestation and degradation facilitates reduction of the cause of climate change and the need for adaptation. Second, detection of ecological changes and attribution of causes guides natural resource management responses toward the predominant factors causing change. Third, spatial analyses of the vulnerability of species and ecosystems to climate change identify the most vulnerable areas and potential refugia. Research is providing information for adaptation measures in development, including wildland fire and prescribed burning to avert catastrophic wildfires, coastal habitat restoration to improve resilience to sea level rise, and conservation of potential refugia for species vulnerable to vegetation shifts.

Title: Gamelan elek trika: An electronic balinese gamelan.

Abstract: This paper describes the motivation and construction of Gamelan Elektrika, a new electronic gamelan modeled after a Balinese Gong Kebyar. The first of its kind, Elektrika consists of seven instruments acting as MIDI controllers accompanied by traditional percussion and played by 11 or more performers following Balinese performance practice. Three main percussive instrument designs were executed using a combination of force sensitive resistors, piezos, and capacitive sensing. While the instrument interfaces are designed to play interchangeably with the original, the sound and travel possiblilities they enable are tremendous. MIDI enables a massive new sound palette with new scales beyond the quirky traditional tuning and non-traditional sounds. It also allows simplified transcription for an aurally taught tradition. Significantly, it reduces the transportation challenges of a previously large and heavy ensemble, creating opportunities for wider audiences to experience Gong Kebyar's enchanting sound. True to the spirit of oneness in Balinese music, as one of the first large all-MIDI ensembles, Elek Trika challenges performers to trust silent instruments and develop an understanding of highly intricate and interlocking music not through the sound of the individual, but through the sound of the whole.

‚ÄúCan‚Äôt Go Home Again‚Äù is inspired by Asheville author Thomas Wolfe‚Äôs book of the same name. Anya found the book to be so richly descriptive in Wolfe‚Äôs longwinded style, especially when the protagonist DOES go home again, which she said, ‚Äúreminded me of something that my dad always used to say: ‚Äòyou can‚Äôt go home again‚Äô!

Learning Objectives: 

By the end of this episode you will be able to:

* describe the difference between acute and chronic pain
* discuss how the different conditions require different approaches

Episode Overview: This episode looks at the differences between acute and chronic pain and highlights the cost of chronic pain to society. It also includes a brief introduction to the idea that, due to the difference between chronic non-malignant pain and other curable conditions, the treatment approach to chronic pain needs to be different.

Abstract: An increasing number of interactive visualization tools stress the integration with computational software like MATLAB and R to access a variety of proven algorithms. In many cases, however, the algorithms are used as black boxes that run to completion in isolation which contradicts the needs of interactive data exploration. This paper structures, formalizes, and discusses possibilities to enable user involvement in ongoing computations. Based on a structured characterization of needs regarding intermediate feedback and control, the main contribution is a formalization and comparison of strategies for achieving user involvement for algorithms with different characteristics. In the context of integration, we describe considerations for implementing these strategies either as part of the visualization tool or as part of the algorithm, and we identify requirements and guidelines for the design of algorithmic APIs. To assess the practical applicability, we provide a survey of frequently used algorithm implementations within R regarding the fulfillment of these guidelines. While echoing previous calls for analysis modules which support data exploration more directly, we conclude that a range of pragmatic options for enabling user involvement in ongoing computations exists on both the visualization and algorithm side and should be used.",Opening the Black Box: Strategies for Increased User Involvement in Existing Algorithm Implementations,9b827a02b193136ed8ead951a00078c20b4738ad,Opening the Black Box: Strategies for Increased User Involvement in Existing Algorithm Implementations,https://vimeo.com/102599534
Lisa Feldman Barrett,"What is an Emotion?
Lisa Barrett, Boston University

Pretty much everyone agrees that emotions play a role in virtually all aspects of mental life. What remains a puzzle, however, is how to define emotions in scientific terms - as psychological and natural phenomena.  Current research is, ironically, guided by a scientific paradigm that is grounded in human experience.  People experience fear and see it in others, so scientists assume there must be a literal (modular) neural circuit for fear in the mammalian brain.  Rats freeze when they hear a tone paired with a foot shock, so they are presumed to be in a state of fear (versus surprise, anger, or even a general state of alarm) and undergoing ‚Äúfear learning.‚Äù Scientists also presume that a map of the neural circuitry of freezing behavior will yield a neural mechanism for fear that is largely preserved in humans, and a decade of neuroimaging studies have focused on locating a homologous neural circuit in the human brain.  In the last five years, I have traced the roots of this ‚Äúnatural kind‚Äù model, conducted a comprehensive review of the literature to examine its veracity, and found it wanting. In response, I have fashioned a new systems-level model, called the Conceptual Act Model. In this model, fear, sadness, happiness, and in fact all the mental events that people name with emotion words are not basic building blocks in the mind or in the brain.  Instead, these mental events result from the interplay of at least two more basic psychological ingredients, or psychological primitives:  core affect (hedonic states with some degree of arousal) and categorization (using conceptual knowledge about emotion).  Individual and cultural differences in emotion can be understood in terms of variation in these ingredients or their interaction.  This model parsimoniously incorporates neuroscience findings from rats, primates, and humans, as well as the psychological findings, and outlines the mechanisms that produce the range and variety of behavioral and introspective instances that people call ‚Äúemotion.‚Äù It also provides a general framework for mapping mind to brain.

Psychiatric drug studies exaggerate benefits of these drugs by study design says Peter Gotzsche, MD

‚ÄúThe randomised trials [of psychiatric drugs] that have been conducted do not properly evaluate the drugs‚Äô effects,‚Äù writes Prof. Peter G√∏tzsche, MD.
‚ÄúAlmost all of them are biased because they included patients already taking another psychiatric drug. 
‚ÄúPatients, who after a short wash-out period are randomised to placebo, go ‚Äúcold turkey‚Äù and often experience withdrawal symptoms.
‚ÄúThis design exaggerates the benefits of treatment and increases the harms in the placebo group, and it has driven patients taking placebo to suicide in trials in schizophrenia.

Getting rid of all antidepressants would improve health, lengthen life says Prof. Peter Gotzsche MD

‚ÄúGiven their lack of benefit, I estimate we could stop almost all psychotropic drugs without causing harm‚Äîby dropping all antidepressants, ADHD drugs, and dementia drugs (as the small effects are probably the result of unblinding bias) and using only a fraction of the antipsychotics and benzodiazepines we currently use,‚Äù writes Prof. Peter G√∏tzsche, MD. ‚ÄúThis would lead to healthier and more long lived populations. ‚ÄúBecause psychotropic drugs are immensely harmful when used long term, they should almost exclusively be used in acute situations and always with a firm plan for tapering off, which can be difficult for many patients. ‚ÄúWe need new guidelines to reflect this.‚Äù

Antipsychotic drugs used for schizophrenia are not very effective notes Prof. Peter Gotzsche, MD

Antipsychotic drugs used for schizophrenia have very little effect on improving the disease notes Prof. Peter G√∏tzsche, MD.

These drugs effect on improving symptoms of the disease when measured on a scale used for schizophrenia (the PANSS) was only 6, when the difference that is considered minimally clinically relevant is 15.

Dr. G√∏tzsche writes:
‚ÄúTrials in schizophrenia [drugs] are also disappointing. ‚ÄúIn newer submissions to the FDA, the effect on the positive and negative syndrome scale (PANSS) was only 6 even though these trials were heavily biased by cold turkey and unblinding effects. ‚ÄúThis is far below the minimally clinically relevant effect, which is about 15.‚Äù

Antidepressants found to have very little effect when compared to active placebo, Peter Gotzsche, MD

Antidepressants have been found to have very little effect when compared to an active placebo‚Äîa placebo which causes dry mouth so that neither the patients nor the researchers can guess who is getting the real drug‚Äînotes Prof. Peter G√∏tzsche, MD.

He notes that the effect of the real antidepressants‚Äîtricyclic antidepressants in these trials‚Äîfound a difference of only 1.3 points on the Hamilton Depression Scale, but the smallest effect that can be perceived is 5-6 points.

Note: Studies show that serotonin reuptake inhibitors SSIR‚Äôs are no more effective than tricyclic antidepressants.

For example, a meta-analysis published in 2000 which compared the efficacy of these two classes of drugs concluded that ‚ÄúThere is no overall difference in efficacy between SSRIs and TCAs [tricyclic antidepressants such as amitriptiline].‚Äù

Dr. G√∏tzsche also notes that other antidepressant studies have found that it only takes a few days longer for the placebo group to improve by 1.3 points on the Hamilton Depression Scale which is simply the spontaneous remission of the disease.

In other words, antidepressants have very little effect and most of the improvement that people experience over time is simply the natural, spontaneous remission of the depression.

Below is a quote of exactly what Dr. G√∏tzsche wrote.

Antidepressants improve depression scores by only 1.3 points

‚ÄúA Cochrane review of tricyclic antidepressants included only trials that had atropine in the placebo to prevent unblinding because of the conspicuous side effects of the drugs. 
[Atropine causes dry mouth as do tricyclic antidepressants. This was done so that the patients and the researchers could not guess who was on the drug.]
‚ÄúThis review did not find any meaningful effect; the effect corresponded to only 1.3 points on the Hamilton scale, and the smallest effect that can be perceived is 5-6 points,‚Äù writes Dr. G√∏tzsche.

‚ÄúA meta-analysis of trials of fluoxetine [Prozac] and venlafaxine [Effexor] in severe depression showed that it takes only a few days longer before the Hamilton score in the placebo group drops by an additional 1.3 points. Thus, if we wait a few days, we would get the same result if taking a placebo, or if the patients weren‚Äôt treated at all, because what we see in a placebo group is not a placebo effect but mainly the spontaneous remission of the disease. The modest observed effect of antidepressants on anxiety can also be explained by unblinding bias because it is similar to that reported for depression.‚Äù

Psychiatric drugs kill 500,000 people each year 65 and older in the US and the European Union notes Prof. Peter Gotzsche, MD.

‚ÄúPsychiatric drugs are responsible for the deaths of more than half a million people aged 65 and older each year in the Western world [in the US and the European Union],‚Äù writes Prof. Peter G√∏tzsche, MD.

Later in the article he writes, ‚ÄúI used Danish prescription statistics to estimate the number of deaths caused by these three classes of drugs. ‚ÄúBecause falls, which are much more common in older people, are an important cause of death in people taking psychotropic drugs, I included only people at least 65 years of age and used conservative death rates: 1% for antipsychotics, 1% for benzodiazepines and similar drugs, and only 2% for antidepressants. ‚ÄúThe total number of deaths a year in Denmark (3693) when scaled up corresponded to 539,000 in the United States and European Union combined.‚Äù

Mohammad Reza Naghii,"What if there were a fuel additive that actually produced an exhaust product that was physiologically beneficial to humans

 Possibly triethylCe, although Ce is noneconomical, Ce has published neuroregenerative effects 

Boron is much more economical it also has published physiological wellness effects.

Possibility that a thing like triethylborane https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triethylborane (or possibly a thing like a differently branched borane tripropylborane or an asymmetric branched boron alkane) could function as antiknock at vehicle fuel with beneficial exhaust.

If this is measured at nonhuman lab mammals at reducing illness then billions of humans could benefit

Noting that about 500 billion gallons of gasoline are utilized annually it is possible that this represents 5 or 15  billion gallons of fuel additive globally, along with the benefits to the public this could be a strong private sector earnings area. 


 It seems possible that although previous Boron fuels as far as I have researched are about higher energy (different than antiknock)  a highly branched version could be an antiknock molecule with exhaust that could possibly be quantitatively measured as causing greater mouse longevity then measured human wellness.

These are the titles of the journal articles suggesting boron as physiologically beneficial   This is from pubmed ""boron TNF' http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=boron+tnf

To address these issues, we present Deep Dyna-Q, which to our knowledge is the first deep RL framework that integrates planning for task-completion dialogue policy learning. We incorporate into the dialogue agent a model of the environment, re-ferred to as the world model, to mimic real user response and generate simulated experience. During dialogue policy learning, the world model is constantly updated with real user experience to approach real user behavior, and in turn, the dialogue agent is optimized using both real experience and simulated experience. The effectiveness of our approach is demonstrated on a movie-ticket booking task in both simulated and human-in-the-loop settings.",Deep Dyna-Q: Integrating Planning for Task-Completion Dialogue Policy Learning,9a23c5f6a998f921e25cd217502841064975e72b,Deep Dyna-Q: Integrating Planning for Task-Completion Dialogue Policy Learning,https://vimeo.com/285805408

W F Munsey,"Mary: I gotta change shoes.

Mary: Okay, there we go. Now, that‚Äôs so much better.

Stuart: Ladies and gentlemen, obviously, let‚Äôs begin at the beginning. Normally, the protocol is that we give people a round of applause at the end of the event. In this particular case, we‚Äôre going to break with all the protocols, because I know a lot of people that are in the audience, I‚Äôve seen faces, I‚Äôve seen people with reputations in the audience, and I think that all of us can say, unanimously that, Mary probably doesn‚Äôt really deeply understand how much impact her singing and her reputation has had in our lives, the way it‚Äôs shaped the love that we‚Äôve got for the music. So, ladies and gentlemen, Mary Wilson of The Supremes, come on.

[applause]

Stuart: So, where to start? Let‚Äôs start with a quick question. Mary, I wanted to -

Mary: Well, I need to explain something.

Stuart: Yes, my dear.

Mary: Okay, before we go any further. I‚Äôm not the founding - the only founding member of The Supremes, as most of you know. Florence, Diane and Betty McGlown, are the founding members of The Supremes, and I cannot take that credit all myself. So, the people here in the audience understand and know that, so, let‚Äôs make that very clear.

Stuart: Well, let‚Äôs start with the first question, I was watching you last night in the opening of the exhibition, singing, and sung a couple of songs for us, it was great, and one of the things that struck me is, actually, without any hesitation, I‚Äôd forgotten how great a solo singer you are, how great a singer you are. And I wonder if that actually, when we go back to The Supremes, there‚Äôs been criticisms in the past, for example, that Diana was actually the least good singer of The Supremes, she had a very specific voice. And I just wanted to get your thoughts about - just describe the different voices that were in The Supremes.

Mary: Well, I don‚Äôt think that you can - anyone said that Diane was the least good singer in The Supremes, that‚Äôs not true, and I‚Äôve never ever said anything like that. My point was always to sort of bring forward the fact that Florence Ballard was a great singer, and I was also a good singer. So, I think people - and sometimes when we tried to explain or say things like that, people think that you‚Äôre saying that the other person is not that good. That was not my point, at all. My point was saying that Florence Ballad was a Gospel, strong singer, Diane was a pop singer and I was kind of, like, the ballad singer, so, we each had our own, you know, good points.

Stuart: And at a time, and in a city, which probably, without any hesitation, you could say was probably, at its time, the greatest musical city in the world, bar none. I mean, if you actually compare and contrast it with the other great regional city of the time, Liverpool, many of the Liverpool acts moved down to London and whatever, but there you were, in Detroit, touring the world, phenomenal place. Just to get some grasp on this, simply your high school alone, who did you go to school with?

Mary: Well, in Detroit, we all kind of grew up in the projects. Detroit was really a small - is, a small town. And Smokey Robinson, I guess, was in the same - lived in the neighbourhood as Diana Ross. I went to high school with some of The Miracles, which was Bobby Rogers. The person that did a lot of singing - or writing, with Smokey Robinson, was Al Gutierrez, Marvin Tarplin, and he and I went to high school together. Florence went to the same high school as some of The Temptations. So, we all came from pretty much the same neighbourhood, even though it was kind of large.

Stuart: And when did you first remember the sense that Mary Wilson had the desire to be a singer? Where did the desire come from?

Mary: Well, you know, people like Little Richard, you know, there was Jackie Wilson, there was Frankie Lyman and The Teenagers was one of my favourite ...

Stuart: He was a bad boy, though, wasn‚Äôt he?

Mary: He was a what?

Stuart: He was a bad boy.

Mary: I don‚Äôt know, I was too young.

Stuart: No, he was a very bad boy, Mary.

Mary: Well, you know, doctors don‚Äôt tell secrets on other doctors. But, we all kind of bad later on. But, yeah, you know, from just - oops, we don‚Äôt want to go there right now - but, anyway, when I was born, my mother said that when the doctors spanked me, I started singing. So, I mean, I did that, but I never ever thought that it was different, I thought that everybody woke up in the morning singing. You know, I thought that everyone did that. I didn‚Äôt realise, until I became one of the members of The Primettes, that that was something very special. Then I realised that that talent was special, but, prior to that, I would just, you know, woke up and start singing, "" ooooooo,"" you know, whatever, and just ...

Stuart: And say a little bit about that photograph, because it connects you back to, like, many Detroit people of your generation, to the Southern States, doesn‚Äôt it? And to the experience of moving north to Detroit, your family and whatever. So, how big was your family? Was it a musical family? What were its origins?

Mary: I actually had one of the smallest families that lived in the Brewster Projects, because my mother had - there were three of us, my baby sister, Cathy, my brother, Roosevelt, and myself, but everyone in the projects had families like, what, you know, eight, nine, ten children, so, we were kind of special, we didn‚Äôt have that many people in the family. But, you know, it‚Äôs amazing, because my mother couldn‚Äôt read nor write, and it‚Äôs something that I‚Äôve often thought about, how music was something that we had more in our family, because we didn‚Äôt read papers, as my mother didn‚Äôt read nor write, and it was just a fun - a fun time, even though it was very, very difficult. My mum was on the welfare, you know, we got cheques every week, we got food for the government, you know, processed cheese, powdered eggs, you know, and stuff like that. But we had the music, so, we were very, very happy.

Stuart: And in terms of the music itself, you talked about that music was around, what kind of music?

Mary: Yes, well, you know, this was in the early days of Rock ‚Äòn‚ÄôRoll, and you had people like Chuck Berry, you know, as I mentioned, Little Richard, and when I was a teenage girl here, I remember I used to be crazy about Jackie Wilson, that was one of my favourite people. And, obviously, Frankie Lyman and The Teenagers was one of my favourites. So, I listened to Rock ‚Äòn‚ÄôRoll, that was my favourite music. However, I grew up listening to Jazz in the household, because that - Jazz and Blues, because that‚Äôs what my family more or less listened to.

Stuart: And were you someone that was, in any way, as you would describe, trained as a musician? Or was it something that was just evolutionary?

Mary: I remember that, when I was in about the sixth grade, maybe earlier than that, actually, I was in one of the glee clubs, and they just pulled me in there, and every year after that, I was always in some type of musical group, in school, you know, like the glee club, the choir. And when I went on to elementary school, like the eighth grade, that‚Äôs when I met Florence Ballard and started really, really singing. But I never had any formal training other than what we received at school. And we had great teachers. That‚Äôs one thing about Detroit, Michigan, the educational system was so good that we had trainers to teach us. And one teacher wanted Florence and I to be opera singers. And I remember, we would sing arias, like -
[sings]
[applause]

Stuart: Yeah, it was really good. I‚Äôve sure you‚Äôve all heard it, it was the B side of Baby Love.

Mary: Right, right, right. And, you know, what was really funny, is that our teacher, when we went on to high school, Mrs Br- I will never forget her, because she had Florence as the - Florence was the soprano lead singer in the girls‚Äôchoir, and I was the alto singer in the girls‚Äôchoir, soloist, and she would really say to us, she would say, "" well, why are you going - why are you singing that music? You and that group, you guys should be doing, you know, doing opera, instead of singing all this stuff."" So, anyway, years later, she would come to our concerts there in Detroit, whenever we worked there, and she would say to us, "" thank God you didn‚Äôt listen to me."" That‚Äôs not cool. She taught us all the basic things about music, so, we really did - but that was the only formal training that we had.

Stuart: At that time in your life, as Rock ‚Äòn‚ÄôRoll was started to influence, and R ‚Äòn‚ÄôB and whatever, and you were having all these other influences from Jazz and from music at school, were you aware that music was, to some extent, still segregated, in that sense that there was a differentiation between race, was that very clear to you?

Mary: Well, I don‚Äôt know about being clear, because when we were growing up, being black was just the way it was, you know, being 'coloured', which we were called in those days. That was a way of life. And you listened to - we listened to all, basically, black music, which was, you know, the Cheravons, the Joe Williams, the BB Kings, and it was basically Blues, Rhythm ‚Äòn‚Äô Blues, that we listened to, and we just felt that that was what everybody was listening to. However, then, when Rock ‚Äòn‚ÄôRoll came along, it sort of changed the demographics of the music in terms of what everyone was listening to, and listening to everything open. Then I started listening to people like Doris Day, you know, in fact, that‚Äôs when I became a blonde. I thought it was Doris Day, you know. Yeah, you thought Tina Turner was the first blonde, but, no, I was.

Stuart: Yeah, no chance. Now, of course, this sort of thing that‚Äôs going on, was the rise in the, if you like, the kind of live music scene in Detroit, the club scene, so, take us back to some of those places that maybe you first started to grow up trying to get in, as a young teenager, The 20 Grand or The Greystone Ballroom or whatever. What was growing up as a teenager like?

Mary: Well, one thing about Detroit is that it really was filled with music, and as we said earlier on, we were surrounded with music, everybody. Music was just a music town, you know, I know they say it was a car factory town, but it was really filled with music. And there was a street called Hastings, if you go into - when you go into the exhibit, you‚Äôll see that they have something written about that. It was a strip of nothing but clubs. So, I mean, the scene was everywhere. Does anyone have a napkin? I really need one.

Stuart: Yeah, could we - has anybody got a tissue or anything like that? There you are, that‚Äôs -

Mary: Oh, thank you. Thank you, so much.

Stuart: No, no, you need to dip - he‚Äôs getting it back, yeah, he wants it back.

Mary: No, no, no, we can‚Äôt do it.
Stuart: No, hey, wait, trust me, that would be framed, and if it wasn‚Äôt framed, it would be on Ebay tonight for 30 grand.

Mary: Well, anyway, so, music was everywhere. And on Hastings, there was lots of clubs. So, I mean, that was something that everyone did, you know, just singing and go to clubs, we were far too young to go to clubs. But, I remember, one time, we did go to The Flame Show Bar, and all of you Motown historians out there, would remember Maurice King, who, he was a big band leader, and he was a band leader for all of the people who came through The Flame Show Bar, like Sarah Vaughan. And I remember we went there and we met Sam Cooke there, and we were too young to even be there, but..., he was very nice. But Maurice later got a job at Motown, and he was the guy that taught us all the harmonies and the things there, so, that was really cool. But there were many, many clubs. The Flame Show Bar, 20 Grand, as you‚Äôve mentioned, The Greystone Ballroom, I remember seeing Jackie Wilson there. Oh, let me tell you a story about Jackie Wilson. There was a time when - I had him up here - oh, he was there, okay, he was there, okay, okay, we passed him, okay - anyway, but I remember, later on in life, when we became famous, well, we weren‚Äôt really big things, but we kind of, a few hit records, we were working at this theatre in Baltimore, Maryland, and Jackie Wilson was on the show, Diane‚Äôs mum was our chaperone at the time. And so she wanted to go to lunch. And, at these shows, you did, like, five or six shows per day, and you had movies in between each show. And so, Mrs Ross said one day to Jackie Wilson, she says, "" Jackie, honey, would you watch the girls while I go and have lunch?"" Which I‚Äôm like, "" Yes! Yes!"" 

Stuart: Yeah, one of the... - and probably one of the more romantic guys, yes, in every sense.

Mary: Oh yes, that was so much fun, yes, yes.

Stuart: Now, one of the other tributaries that coming along at this time is the rise, really, of, kind of, image and style, and that‚Äôs one of the things that the exhibition explores. When did you first begin to become passionate about fashion and look and visual style and the way in which you deported yourself?

Mary: Well, personally, that was something that I was always involved in, and Diane was always involved in, we all liked fashion. I remember having a tea party when I was eight years old, and I dressed up in my Aunt Ivy‚Äôs clothes and got the first spanking of my life, ‚Äòcause I destroyed her clothes in my little tea party that I was having at eight. So, I was really always into fashion, Diana was into fashion, in fact, she was taking up fashion in school and studying fashion design, and Florence, we all liked to dress up. So, when we started singing, initially, Diane and I would make some of the clothes, some of the inexpensive dresses, and then we started buying clothes from Saks Fifth Avenue, which was definitely a dream come true. And then when we became very famous, we started having the designers. So, fashion was something that we always loved. And when a Motown - or Berry Gordy, saw us, when we auditioned, I think they recognised that we really liked being pretty, and so they used that, you know. And people have this misunderstanding that Motown made us dress up and they made us look like this, and they picked our clothes. They didn‚Äôt do any of that, you know, we did it all. Of course, some of the chaperones would assist us, you know, and suggest things or whatever, but it was basically our - just the way we were.

Stuart: And was that same... you were actually coached? I mean, you read all the histories of Motown, and they all talk about, you know, deportment and how to conduct yourself.

Mary: The charm school ... development.

Stuart: The charm school, yeah, what was the charm school really like?

Mary: Well, here it is, because, you see my legs here, they‚Äôre kind of nice now, but they used to be - I mean, when thin was kind of like nothing -

Stuart: Mary, I‚Äôm trying not to look, but I can see what you mean, yeah.

Mary: Okay, well, but I mean, but, you know, when you‚Äôre young, you don‚Äôt know how to sit, because I‚Äôm teaching my grandchildren, my granddaughter, right now, how to sit, so, I can‚Äôt really do it - I should have on pants and then I could really do it. But, you know, girls sit like this, you know, and stuff like that. And so, in charm school, Mrs Maxine Powell, would teach us how to sit, because she said, 'one day, you girls are going to be singing before kings and queens', and we‚Äôre like, 'sure. She must be off her - what is she drinking? Right.' And so, I mean, yeah, 16, you know, and coming from where we came from. Well, of course, this was nowhere to - but she taught us how to, you know, sit, and she said, 'ladies are always supposed to sit with their knees closed, no matter how short' - you know, because minis were in, you know, 'so, your knees are always closed. And then you can cross them at the bottom, or you can sit, really, your body language is very important.' So, we were taught that at Motown by Maxine Powell when we were 16 years old. And it‚Äôs something that I think we‚Äôve always used. I remember, we were doing the Murray The K Show in New York, and lots of people on the show, Dusty Springfield was on the show, The Ronettes. And everyone would always say, 'we could always tell all of the Motown acts when they came on, because their sort of body language, everything was really professional.' So, that was something that we got from Motown Records.

Stuart: Yeah. One of the things about Motown Records that is often said is that Berry Gordy or, at least, the Motown system, borrowed a lot from Detroit and from the car plants in the sense of the division of labour, that people had a job and they did the job and they did it for high specification, and some of the tracks kept coming and were reused again. Is that the way that you saw it? Did you see this as a kind of, you know -

Mary: No, we didn‚Äôt see it like that. You know, the one - another misconception that people have is that we were just taken and just totally changed over. What people have to understand is that the black experience in America at that time was very important to the black family, and we were taught, by our own families, how to be good little girls or good little boys, they would tell us, "" when you go out on the street, you represent the black race, so, you must act accordingly."" So, we were taught very well before we even got there. Now, the professionalism that we gained at Motown was more of teaching us the etiquette, you know, the finer things, so that we would know. But Mrs Powell put it best, and she said - she would tell us this, and it was so wonderful when she would say it, because we‚Äôd feel so good, you know, she would say, "" you ladies and you guys are just diamonds in the rough, we‚Äôre here just to polish you up."" And that‚Äôs really what was going on. And that was such a great compliment, because we really were - it was our decision to be there, you know, no one just said, "" okay, you, you, you, we‚Äôre going to make you into stars,"" we were there because we wanted to be there.

Stuart: You mentioned earlier on there in the conversation, "" when we became really famous,"" you say.

Mary: Well, we were always famous in our minds.

Stuart: Indeed, yeah, indeed, but what was the moment, the one moment in time, that Mary Wilson personally has imprinted in her mind as the time she became really famous? What made you think, "" wow, this is a bit different?"" What was the moment or the time or the experience?

Mary: Well, let me just add something a little bit more, for me, that was more important than that, it was when I met Florence, Diane and Betty. That‚Äôs the moment that I really knew what and who I was. Because, when I met them, it was almost like they were the other parts of me that I didn‚Äôt possess, and I loved them equally, and I saw just who I was, through them, and just singing, sort of, at that moment, I‚Äôm the same person now that I was at that moment, because of meeting them. I think had I not met Florence, Diane and Betty and, eventually, Bob, I wouldn‚Äôt be the woman that I am. So, that was, for me, more defining, as a human being, to find something in life - and I try to tell my son this, he‚Äôs still looking for himself, he‚Äôs 30 - you know, sometimes you‚Äôre not fortunate to find something that you can be passionate about in life, to make your life meaningful. And I think we were very - for me, that was the most fabulous thing that ever happened. So, the records - as I said earlier, in our mind, we were already famous, because when we found each other, we knew just who we were, what were good at.

Stuart: And were you conscious of having a kind of driving ambition or whatever, because there‚Äôs so many other great singers - you‚Äôve listed some of them - who didn‚Äôt have quite the same level of fame as The Supremes, other people who were fantastic at Motown, that just simply disappeared after maybe one or two songs or whatever. So, what was it that gave you that sense of longevity?

Mary: I would say, you know, Berry Gordy taking a big interest in us and believing in us, and seeing how dedicated we were - because we were young girls, I mean, originally, he didn‚Äôt want us there, because he only saw young girls, and for him, he probably said, "" you know, I don‚Äôt want these teenage girls running round my studio and getting in trouble and then I‚Äôm the blame, you know,"" so, he turned us down. But, after seeing that we were so dedicated and so in love with what we did, he believed in us, too, and he gave us the writing team of Holland-Dozier-Holland, and that was that defining moment, because they gave us the music.

Stuart: Yeah, and all those great songs. But, before that happened, he put you on -

Mary: [inaudible]

Stuart: You were on this big - I‚Äôve seen the photograph of you, on the bus, the coach, the bus that takes you all over America, and you were doing the Motown Review, probably 63, 64, something like that. What was that experience like? You know, here you are, a young black Detroit girl, in a single coach, with some pretty heavy guys, let‚Äôs be honest.

Mary: Oh, it was fun.

Stuart: Yeah, yeah.

Mary: It was great.

Stuart: Was it great? And were you always chaperoned, Mary Wilson?

Mary: Yes, we were, yes, we were, we were. We were chaperoned until we were well into our 20s, we were probably 25, when we had chaperones. In fact, the first trip here, I think Diane‚Äôs mum was with us on that particular trip, and that was 64. So, we were - you know, as I said, Berry Gordy was very afraid that we would, you know, probably end up pregnant or something like that, because there was, like, all these guys running around Motown, you know, Marvin Gaye, you know, The Temptations, The Four Tops, you know, The Spinners, The Contours, it was like, "" well, I‚Äôd better"" - you know, so, he was pretty adamant about always having someone with us, to take care of us.

Stuart: And you‚Äôre driving through areas where, in the past, where Black R ‚Äòn‚ÄôB singers or Soul singers or Jazz singers or whatever, were actually living largely in segregated lifestyles when they toured the Southern States and that, did you ever feel that you witnessed that, that you were party to that, that you could see it close up?

Mary: Party to what?

Stuart: Well, the segregation in the South at the time?

Mary: Oh, you know, that‚Äôs a very good point, because when we were living in Detroit, you know, in your own neighbourhood - I‚Äôm sure it‚Äôs like that in most areas, that your ethnic group lives, you know, you live in one area, you know, there‚Äôs the Irish area, just whatever area it is, Italian area, the Chinese area, and all this kind of stuff. Well, we were the same way, we lived in the black area. So, you know, we didn‚Äôt have a lot of interaction with segregation, because, in our area, it was cool. And the people who had stores and things like that, who were of other ethnic groups, well, our teachers, some of them were white, some of the store owners were white, so, you know, they were all - they knew us, by names, so, we didn‚Äôt really come in contact with that. When we started travelling, yes, we did. Or, like my family was originally from the south, and I would travel down there, to the south, you know, on summers, and that‚Äôs when I would see a lot of this. So, we were well aware of what was going on, but it wasn‚Äôt so blatant. You knew, if the water fountain said "" Coloured,"" that‚Äôs the one you drink out of, you didn‚Äôt drink out of the one that said "" White."" So, you just did what you were supposed to do, and it was never really a problem, you know. I remember, when my father passed, it was the year I graduated, in 61 or 62, something like that, and I had to go south to bury him, with my family, and my cousin, who lived in the south, Josephine, and I, went to buy his little socks and the gloves and all the kind of stuff, and so I was telling the guy, "" I want some nice socks for my dad."" So, he gave me these cheap pair of socks. So, I looked at my cousin, "" oh, these are cheap, I don‚Äôt want these for my dad, give me something else, da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da."" And she was saying, "" sh, don‚Äôt say it too loud,..., you might get hurt."" And I‚Äôm like, "" what? I mean, you know, I‚Äôm paying for what I want."" I mean, I wasn‚Äôt being disrespectful, but it was just - the idea was, that was what I was supposed to just have, and, you know, accept it. No, my money is here, so. In those instances, you know, you knew what your parents had been telling you about, and you understood, so, when we got to the south, we understood that then, because we were young adults at that point. And it was kind of odd to perform, you know, you have to remember that Stevie Wonder, Mary Wells, Marvin Gaye, all of us were on the same bus, and we were, you know, doing these great shows, and one show, say, the black audience would be on the bottom of the floor, and the white ones would be in the balcony, and then another one, they will switch, you know. But, there is a story, on this particular bus, we were in Florida, and we were driving in, and there was a motel and there was a pool, and so we had been driving all day and was really tired and hot and everything, and we‚Äôre like, "" oh, a pool, okay, great, check in there, we‚Äôre going to jump into the pool."" And all the white people who were in the pool jumped out. They were like, out. And so, anyway, we didn‚Äôt care, we just come - because we were young, you know, when you‚Äôre young, you know, you‚Äôre not trying to do anything, you just want to have fun. And so there was music playing, and some of the music from the show was on there, and the people found out that we were the -

Stuart: The show, yeah.

Mary: The stars. They all came back in the water, we had a great day. We all just partied together, you know. So, music is one of those things, I‚Äôve found out, that it‚Äôs really - it brings people together, it really, really does.

Stuart: Now, you mentioned Holland-Dozier-Holland, now, I‚Äôve got to ask you this, Mary, if it was reduced to - there it is, Hitsville USA - if it was reduced to one single song that you - there they are, the ten... there they are, Holland-Dozier-Holland, right?

Mary: ...mini-documentary.

Stuart: One single song, you‚Äôve got to reduce it all down to one song, what‚Äôs the greatest song and why?

Mary: Of Supremes, Motown, or any song?

Stuart: Of Holland-Dozier-Holland for The Supremes?

Mary: Oh, oh, oh. Oh, gee, that‚Äôs hard, that‚Äôs hard.

Stuart: That‚Äôs hard, yeah, I know, but there‚Äôs no such thing as a free lunch, Mary.

Mary: I know, I know, I know. Yeah, right, I‚Äôve learned that. Gee, you know, I really like some of The Four Tops, their songs, "" Baby, I Need Your Loving,"" that‚Äôs one of my all-time favourites, "" Seven Rooms of Gloom,"" I don‚Äôt know if they did that or not. But, you know, of The Supremes‚Äôsongs, gee, "" Reflections"" is great, "" I Hear a Symphony"" is great. I wasn‚Äôt as crazy about some of the earlier ones, because they were kind of young, and we wanted to be grown up, yeah, so, they were like too bubble gum, whereas, then we started doing "" You Can‚Äôt Hurry Love"" and things like that, and we really liked those.

Stuart: Well, last night, when you came on stage, you even did that.

Mary: Yeah, well, because, you know that, because people - that hand movement - Charlie Atkins, too, we had to bring Charlie up into this, Charlie Atkins was also in the Artist Development Department, and he taught everyone the moves. And that was one of the most famous moves, other than The Temptations walk... And so, you know, when I do that, it‚Äôs because almost like "" The Happening,"" you know, the record, "" The Happening,"" was the soundtrack to a movie, and "" The Happening"" record became a hit record and the movie was a flop. But, you know, we were all thrilled that we were doing a soundtrack back at that time, you know, we Supremes did a lot of firsts, you know, television specials, we had the first television special, with The Temptations, we did a lot of commercials, so, there was a lot of firsts that we did. But that hand movement was great because it is as famous as the music itself, which shows you what a combination that Motown machinery was. You know, people say, "" well, don‚Äôt you hate Motown? You said this and you said this, you didn‚Äôt get paid."" But that‚Äôs a whole another story, it has nothing to do with the beauty of it, that, you know, when you look back when you‚Äôre young and you see that you didn‚Äôt get as much money as you should, but, I mean, the adults, they know their stuff and, you know, you don‚Äôt know it. You‚Äôd sell your soul just to get in there and sing a song or record, so, you‚Äôre not thinking about the money. Later on, you‚Äôre thinking about it. And the fact that I brought all this up, people think that I hate Motown, but, no, I love Motown, I just think that they should have been fair. But all the record companies were doing that, you know. I spoke to some of The Drifters, and they were saying the same thing, you know, in fact, they said they were on salary, which was really bad, you know. So, anyway, the hand movement became very, very famous, yes.

Stuart: Now, I want to talk a bit about the year 1967, when you were already very, very famous, and it was the beginning - you mentioned there the release of "" The Happening,"" which I think was about February or March of that year.

Mary: Was it? Oh, you know more - you remember that stuff? I don‚Äôt remember.

Stuart: I complete -

Mary: I don‚Äôt remember, I had to ask one of my friends, you know. I call them up and say, "" Hey, Rossty, what did we make in 1965?"" You know.

Stuart: Well, Mary, excuse me, I‚Äôm one of these complete bores, of whom there‚Äôs thousands in the audience.

Mary: Yeah, right, right, right, okay, yes.

Stuart: January, 1967, it‚Äôs the new year, and I think, actually, you‚Äôd been doing the Orange Bowl in Florida, you‚Äôd been doing an icescapade or something like that, that you were doing in Florida, and you were turning back and there was snow all over the city -

Mary: In Florida?

Stuart: And it was the beginning - not in Florida, no, in Detroit, alright, you remember, right. No, Florida was where you dived into the pool.

Mary: I‚Äôm 64, I‚Äôm not senile. Quit . . .

Stuart: Okay, right, snow on the ground, Florence Ballard is beginning to - something‚Äôs happening in The Supremes, what was happening? Give us your truthful version of what actually was happening.

Mary: Well, you know, if you really want the real true story, you‚Äôve got to read my book.

Stuart: I‚Äôve read both versions.

Mary: I know it‚Äôs not here in the VA, but maybe you can tell they should get it here, okay. Alright, this is the real story, and I really wrote about that, about Florence, in depth. It‚Äôs a very long story to explain it all, and perhaps I can just do it quickly, just so everybody really understands. You know, Florence was abused when she was very young. We were in the Pr- as well, during the time, and the young man who did this, I think he was caught and put in prison. But, she was a virgin, and was raped. So, then, of course, we got to deal with Motown and we became famous and all these kind of things, and I think that Diane and I really felt that, you know, she was over this, and we didn‚Äôt know the depth, because we were very young at the time, we just didn‚Äôt understand it. But it totally destroyed Florence. I mean, she was distraught at that point. Thank God, we still had our - you know, we had our fame and all that stuff and, as I said, we really felt that she was okay, but she wasn‚Äôt. So, eventually, it came - and she never got help, because during that time, unlike now, people are helping children who are abused, and they really, you know, you go therapy and you do all these things, but, in those days, you didn‚Äôt do that, you kept quiet.

Stuart: You just closed it off, yeah.

Mary: You kept quiet, you didn‚Äôt want people to know, no one - you know, so, you didn‚Äôt get the help that you should, and that‚Äôs what happened to Florence. She didn‚Äôt get the professional help to help her get rid of some of these things. So, whenever anything would go wrong, then she would get unhappy and then, of course, she would get more and more unhappy. And, you know, you start drinking to cover up the pain. So, people were saying that she was drinking too much, but she was just hurting. And eventually, it got to the point where she was unable to really do her j",An Interview with Mary Wilson of the Supremes,6f0effe000fa238406ac97fd85e33381d5c82201,There's no such thing as a free lunch.,https://vimeo.com/16612943
Risto Sarvas,"Rationale

I hope to illustrate how storytelling is a practice that humans have always indulged and that vernacular creativity is another extension of this biographical story telling that has evolved within the social sphere. Snap shot photography does not necessarily just hold memories but creates messages as exemplified through this presentation. Yet, it also has technological and socio-cultural benefits and consequences.

Barack H Obama,"March 2017‚ÄîThis video is the third and final installment in a 3-part commentary series featuring PLMI President, Dr. Jeffrey Bland. Designing a healthcare system that is comprehensible, efficient, and cost-effective is an incredibly complex undertaking. How do all of the pieces fit together? What changes will we see as the remainder of 2017 unfolds? As we follow this national dialogue, certainly there has been anger, anxiety, and outcry. At the same time, we are living in an era of innovation, optimism, and opportunity. In this video, Dr. Bland comments on the Affordable Care Act, which he has been following since its inception, as well as the current challenges that policymakers, reimbursement providers, clinicians, patients, and a concerned populace are facing as we all press ahead in seeking solutions for the future.

Barack H Obama,"The Affordable Care Act (ACA) was signed into law by President Barack Obama in March 2010. Although controversy ensued, the United States Supreme Court upheld the law in 2012 and implementation continued to move forward. Key objectives of the ACA include increasing access to health care, improving quality, and lowering costs. Four years later, where do things stand? President Obama has penned a progress report. In August, he made the unique choice to publish this update in one of the world‚Äôs most respected medical journals, the Journal of the American Medical Association. Dr. Bland read this report with great interest, as well as a series of companion articles also featured in JAMA. In this video, Dr. Bland offers his perspective on the incredibly complex‚Äîbut hugely important‚Äîinitiative to change the architecture of the American health care system and to set a new standard that is focused on wellness and prevention.

Lisa Marshall,"Sleep, Cognition and State Dependent Modulation
Lisa Marshall, University of L√ºbeck, Germany

One of the suggested functions of sleep has been to modulate cognitive activity such as to facilitate the reorganization and storage (termed consolidation) of memory. Sleep is measured behaviorally and electrophysiologically. The latter allows a precise distinction of different sleep states reflecting the depth of sleep, and these sleep stages can be grouped further into non-rapid eye movement (NREM) and rapid eye movement (REM) sleep. NREM and REM sleep alternate several times throughout the sleep period in mammals and are associated not only with activity within different brain structures, but also with specific modulations in brain neurochemistry, the constellation of which can specifically impact sleep-associated cognitive processes such as memory consolidation. Furthermore, storage of memories of different contents (e.g., emotional, autobiographical, semantic) relies differentially on the activity of the sleep states. The linkage between brain electric oscillatory activity and sleep-associated processes of memory formation will be reported in humans and rodents. Moreover, the impact of subthreshold modulations by applied electric currents on cortical activity and behavior will be described.

Venkatasubramanian Ganesan, National Institute of Mental Health and Neurosciences

Aristotle‚Äôs famous quote ‚Äúthere is no great genius without a mixture of madness‚Äù aptly signifies the enigmatic relationship between ‚Äúcreativity‚Äù and ‚Äúinsanity‚Äù; indeed, the quest to understand this enigma has been persistent since past many centuries.  Adaptive evolutionary theorists argue that the natural selection should have eliminated gene pools that confer any risk towards psychosis especially since these illnesses adversely impact fecundity; hence, persistence of these illnesses supports the view of associated adaptive advantages ‚Äì creativity is one such postulated benefit.  Lateralized brain function is regarded as one of the critical event underlying the evolution of Homo sapiens.  The correlates of creativity with aberrant hemispheric lateralization support the link between creativity and human brain evolution.  Interestingly, aberrant hemispheric lateralization has also been demonstrated in psychoses.  Recent neurobiological research works have further strengthened the elusive link between creativity and insanity.  For example, a biologically relevant polymorphism of the promoter region of the neuregulin 1 gene, which is linked with schizophrenia, has been shown to be associated with creativity in people with high intellectual and academic performance.  Another interesting recent observation is the relationship between decreased thalamic dopamine receptor density and creativity; it is noteworthy that dopamine is one of the important neurotransmitters implicated in psychoses and thalamus deficit is a replicated research finding in schizophrenia.  The link between creativity and psychiatry extends much beyond psychoses implicating autism spectrum disorders.  However, a critique on current status of postulated evolutionary links between creativity & psychosis might argue that such speculations are ‚Äòpanglossian‚Äô.  Nonetheless, such research attempts emphasize the need for much neglected ‚Äúdistal etiology-based‚Äù approaches in contemporary psychiatry research since ‚ÄúNothing in biology makes sense except in the light of evolution‚Äù.

Leonardo Neumeyer,"S4: DISTRIBUTED STREAM COMPUTING PLATFORM
Leo Neumeyer & Anish Nair (Yahoo!)
Tuesday, January 25, 2011

ABSTRACT

S4 is a general-purpose, distributed, scalable, partially fault-tolerant, pluggable platform that allows programmers to easily develop applications for processing continuous unbounded streams of data. Keyed data events are routed with affinity to Processing Elements (PEs), which consume the events, update state and optionally, produce event streams of their own. The architecture resembles the Actors model, providing semantics of encapsulation and location transparency, thus allowing applications to be massively concurrent while exposing a simple programming interface to application developers. In this talk, we outline the S4 architecture in detail, describe various applications, including real-life deployments. Our design is primarily driven by large scale applications for data mining and machine learning in a production environment. We show that the S4 design is surprisingly flexible and lends itself to run in large clusters built with commodity hardware.

BIOGRAPHY

Leo Neumeyer studied electrical and computer engineering in Argentina and Canada. In 1992 he joined the Speech Technology and Research lab at SRI International (formerly Stanford Research Institute), where he helped build one of the most advanced speech recognition systems that was commercialized by its spin off company, Nuance Communications. Leo did research in signal processing, speech recognition, and language learning technologies. In 1999, he co-founded Mindstech International, a startup that developed technology to teach spoken English in Asia over the Internet. In 2006 he joined Yahoo! Labs where he led the search advertising optimization sciences group. More recently he championed S4, an open source distributed stream computing software platform that was developed to model user feedback in real-time to improve search revenue and user experience. He published over 24 technical papers and 8 patents.

Anish Nair is an applied scientist at Yahoo! Labs, working mainly on prediction and optimization problems in search monetization. His areas of interest and prior experience are natural language processing, information retrieval, speech recognition, personalization, and of late, stream computing. He has published work in various areas: computational linguistics, distributed systems, psychometrics and cognitive science. Prior to Yahoo!, he developed algorithms for automatically evaluating people's spoken ability, at Ordinate Corporation (now part of Pearson) and worked on various computational linguistics problems while a graduate student at USC. Anish's current focus is envisioning and developing applications for S4, the stream computing platform.","Tech Talk: Leo Neumeyer & Anish Nair (Yahoo!) -- ""S4: Distributed Stream Computing Platform""",2f7f5d0e989c74d6279e2620e10e8d0b0c021cb7,S4: Distributed Stream Computing Platform,https://vimeo.com/20489778
Xiuli Ren,"Keynote Title: Security Mechanisms for Wireless Sensor Networks

Keynote Lecturer: Dr. Utz Roedig

Keynote Chair: Dr. Stephen Fairclough
Presented on: 09-01-2014, Lisbon, Portugal

Abstract: We depend on Wireless Sensor Networks in our daily life. For instance, such systems are used for building automation, traffic management, process automation in factories and plants and are used to monitor patients in hospitals. It is therefore necessary to implement security mechanisms for these systems to ensure resilience against attacks and to prevent misuse. For example, you would like to prevent your neighbour from switching on and off the lights within your smart home. In this talk I will first discuss the general security challenges in wireless sensor networks. In particular, I intend to describe why it is difficult to transfer existing security mechanisms into the wireless sensor network domain. Current security WSN research challenges are outlined and open research questions and areas that require attention are highlighted. My recent work has addressed some of the open issues. I want to show you how WSNs can be interconnected securely with the Internet using 6LowPAN extensions for IPSec. Furthermore, I will describe how secure data storage on sensor nodes can be implemented and integrated with secure communication to provide true end-to-end security. The keynote shall conclude with a discussion on novel security mechanisms such as distance based authentication and wireless firewalls and I will show how these mechanisms can be implemented and how they may help to secure future WSN deployments.

Cochrane Collaboration, ‚ÄúContinuous Passive Motion Following Total Knee Arthroplasty in People with Arthritis.‚Äù Published by John Wiley & Sons, Ltd. Copyright ¬©2014.

There was great hope at one time for Continuous Passive Motion
In the 1970‚Äôs & 80‚Äôs machines called CPM‚Äôs (Continuous Passive Motion) were developed to try to aid in knee replacement recovery. Doctors used CPM‚Äôs because the concept of early motion after knee replacement made sense. Since then many studies have evaluated their effectiveness. Results both in the short and long terms were controversial, conflicting and in the end unimpressive. These conclusions are not surprising. Even so you may still see CPM‚Äôs in use today by some doctors and hospitals. Drew Logue from Advanced Physical Therapy describes his own use of a CPM machine for a football injury when he was younger, and how it compares to the X10 that he uses daily with knee replacement patients in this video clip

X10‚Ñ¢ Computer Controlled PMKR: Pressure Modulated Knee Rehabilitation
Regaining passive range of motion (ROM[1]). During the first few days and weeks post TKA[2] there is a golden opportunity to take action and avoid a life-long restriction in range of motion. To take advantage of this opportunity it is necessary to extend and flex the leg with just enough pressure to naturally ‚Äúpump‚Äù fluid from the periarticular[3] tissue. This process will expel the fluid that contains the seeds (Fibroblasts[4]) that will develop into scar tissue. The critical zone in which to accomplish this is less than one degree in size, right at the edge of comfortable movement. Applying too much pressure will move the leg beyond this small region and cause the fluids in the knee to become overly compressed, and can cause intense pain. Applying too little pressure will not move the leg enough, is ineffective in squeezing out the fluid, and is in general non-productive use of the patient‚Äôs time. Only the patient, listening to his own body, knows the maximum amount of pressure with which he is comfortable. Only with movement within these very tight angles can fluid be expelled from the region, and range of motion regained.

he X10 accomplishes this goal of productive early movement after surgery. Extremely sensitive patented pressure technology puts control over the amount of pressure exerted on the leg into the hands of the patient. The patient sets the maximum pressure he is comfortable with, and then can focus on making rapid gains in range of motion without fear of sharp or excessive pain. As the patient achieves increases in range of motion she adjusts the pressure as frequently as needed to continue to work within her own unique pain threshold. Patients do not waste their valuable rehab time with motion that has become too easy. Instead they are able to make each session on the X10 highly productive.
CPM machines do not possess the necessary technology to work within the narrow, very precise window of effectiveness, where meaningful gains in ROM can occur. CPM parameters are set by the caregiver; it is very difficult to properly set up a patient in a CPM device. The motion alternates between two fixed angles with very little opportunity for improvement. This often results in spending valuable time on ineffective movement, time that could be better applied elsewhere. There is also the potential to aggravate the knee with excessive motion beyond the pain threshold, setting back the patient‚Äôs recovery.

Regaining Strength Leads to Active Range of Motion
Achieving passive normal ROM is only the first step in a full recovery. This must be followed by muscle strengthening to achieve active ROM. The X10‚Ñ¢ has three very important strengthening components: strength at end of stroke, eccentric strengthening, and concentric strengthening.

Patients almost universally dislike CPM machines; they are often compared to torture devices. Darlene shares her experience with both a CPM machine and X10 for her TKA recovery in this video.

‚ÄúWhat I dread, more than surgery, is having to strap my leg into the continuous passive motion machine for six hours a day when I get home from the hospital. While you‚Äôre flat on your back staring at the ceiling, the monotonous motion machine bends your leg, it straightens your leg. Bend. Straighten. Bend. Straighten. Six hours of this. The police should strap suspects into these things. They‚Äôll confess to anything.‚Äù

M. P. Cooke,"Tracking speakers is an important application in smart environments. Here, often microphone arrays are used for acoustic localization and tracking. In contrast to most state-of-the-art approaches that are based on correlation measures, a neurologically inspired system [1] is employed, which generalizes findings about human spatial hearing to the multi-channel case. It mimics the processing in the human cochlea and the auditory mid-brain. To enhance the localization quality, a new spike generation approach is introduced, termed peak-over-average position (PoAP) [1]. A fuzzy combination is used to combine the correlation results of individual microphone pairs. In reverberant and noisy environments, only a few clearly localized time-frequency events can be found. The ``glimpsing model'' suggests that human speech perception in adverse conditions is based upon sparse clear events with high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) [3]. To localize and track multiple speakers in reverberant environments, clearly localized ``glimpses'' can be integrated to continuous speaker tracks. This is done by a Time-To-Live tracking framework inspired by [4].

The recordings were done in the meeting room of the FINCA [2] using a circular equidistant microphone array consisting of eight omnidirectional microphones hung from the ceiling, with an omincam in the middle. Behringer ECM8000 microphones were attached to an SM Pro Audio PR8E amplifier, connected to an M-Audio Delta 1010 sound card in turn connected to a PC with Q9550 Core2Quad CPU and 8 GB RAM running Kubuntu Linux. The room is almost rectangular, about 3.7 x 6.8 x 2.6 m with high reverberation. A reverberation time of 0.624 s over all microphone signals was calculated using a blind estimation algorithm [5].

To test concurrent speaker separation, two speakers were walking around the array while talking. The sequence is 45 s long, it is available as single eight channel file. The ground truth is also available as a separate CSV-file [http://www.irf.tu-dortmund.de/cms/en/IS/Research/ASP/index.html].

In order to demonstrate the tracking, the omnicam video was overlayed by transparent angular segments generated from the tracking results. Also note that the audio is stereo taken form the outer left and right microphone.

Building muscle is a slow process. It could take weeks and months just to add on couple pounds of lean muscle mass. And even though there's no way around the hard work and putting in the time there are proven ways that you can speed up your progress. So Today I'll be going over the 5 best ways to build muscle faster as a natural. And these aren't going to be just some random tips based on broscience, every tip is 100% backed by real scientific evidence. By following the recommendations drawn from the Decades of research on building muscle we can be guaranteed to get faster results. The first way to speed up results is by increasing training frequency, training intensity, and your training volume per session. Training frequency refers to the number of days per week that you work the same muscle groups. So if you only work each muscle in your body once a week, you'll have a lower training frequency than someone working each muscle 3 time a week. With training volume I'm referring to a combination of the total amount of sets and reps you perform for each muscle group. And intensity refers to the weight load you're using. You can think of the total amount of work your perform as frequency x sets x reps x weight load. Studies show that if your goal is to build more muscle we want to work on increasing the total amount of work performed over time as we adapt. One study compared the effects of working muscle groups 1 day per week using a split-body routine versus 3 days per week using a total-body routine. The total body routine 3 times a week had a significant advantage over the split training routine targeting each muscle one time per week. Those in the 3 time per week group experienced a 68 percent increase in quad thickness as well as much greater increases in forearm size and strength when compared to the 1 time per week group.

Andrew C. Singer,"Bioremediation of Pollutants 
Yongming LUO
(Institute of Soil Science, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Nanjing PR China)

This presentation gives general introduction of bioremediation of pollutants in the environment, with particular emphasis in recent research progresses and development trends in soil bioremediation of heavy metals, persistent organic pollutants and petroleum in China. Bioremediation generally covers phytoremedaiton and microbial remediation. Phytoremdiation including phytoextraction by using hyperaccumulating plants, phytomobilsation by ennery crops, phytovatilisation by genetically-modified genotypes has been adopted for decontamination of toxic metals in soils. Field demonstration shows significant removal of toxic metals such as As or Cd by using hyperaccumulators (e.g. Chinese brake fern or sedum alfredii). Microbial remediation including rhizo-remediation and myco-remediation by inoculation of effective fungi and bacteria has been mainly studied for degradation of persistent organic pollutants such as polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) in soil. In-situ and ex-situ bioremediation technologies have also been developed for cleanup of petroleum-contaminate soil. Natural attenuation has a remarkable reduction in chlorinated pesticides in agricultural soil. Hybrid remedaiton techniques are being studied for restoration of mixed polluted land. Future trends in bioremediation reserach and management in China should cover the following aspects:(1) more attention to phytomanagement of organic pollutants; (2) from empirical study to mechanistic study to obtain better understanding of underlying processes at a molecular level, (3) from laboratory simulation to real world situation for making bioremediation work in the field, (4) multidisciplinary study for further development, optimization, and site demonstration of biotechnology; and (5) enforcement of soil enviornmental risk assessment and quality standards and implementation of soil pollution prevention and remediation legislation.

Life. Life is unpredictable. At times it opens doors for you and at other times it grinds you to a pulp, but every cloud has a silver lining... maybe that is what makes it worth living. 

Bert Ribul was once a young kid like anybody else, until that day when he was struck by a sight he will never forget and that which forever altered his life. A few years back it seemed like he wouldn't be able to pursue that what he has once found as a kid...

This was a completely self-funded project with no support of any companies. I did want to try an idea that was going around in my head for a very very long time and being absent from the scene and filming in general for 3.5-4 years I had no expectations going in. I didn't know whether Bert has changed his number or not, but I gave it a shot and wrote to him. That very same late evening got a reply and the rest is history as they say. Won't bore you with the details and will just let you enjoy.

Thank you to the artists as well for allowing us to use their outstanding songs for this project and thank you to the security guard that let us shoot at that particular parking lot without any confrontations, despite the fact his superiors were telling him to throw us out.

Sarah Piggett,"In 1980 the album Duke was intended to contain a 30 minute suite of music that would take the entire side of the album, telling the story of a fictional character ""Albert."" While the band separated these songs on the record to prevent comparisons to their most recognizable epic, ""Supper's Ready,"" we present it to you as god and Banks intended...

Phil's introduction:

This next piece of the show here is all about a friend of ours whose name is Albert, and Albert was a born loser. 

He once fell in love - with a lady. Her name was Duchess, and she was really beautiful. The Duchess was into S&M...but poor old Albert didn't speak Spanish or Mexican so she kicked him out. 

He went home that night very disappointed, very dejected. He sat down and turned on the television. Suddenly his life changed because Albert was in love again. Albert fell in love, unfortunately, with the television set (bit of a strange one was Albert.) It was a bit of a one-sided affair, and within two or three days Albert had to go into hospital and have the glass removed from his private parts. 

So he went on a convalescing holiday abroad where tragedy struck again - because soon Albert was back in love - this time with his walking stick. (Yes, Albert was a bit of a weirdo) And I think you've guessed it - within two or three days he was back in hospital having the walking stick removed from his private parts. 

Well, Albert decided to give up this holiday as a bad job. And he came back to England where he entered a home for unsuccessful young lovers. (It's a shame, i'nt it?) This was called Duke's End. But every cloud has a silver lining, and every silver lining has a cloud. And every bin has a liner. And it was within this bin that Albert wrote some of his easily forgettable books. He reckoned himself a literary genius (with a habit). But unfortunately he was a bit late on the boat because he wrote books like ""Albert Through the Looking Glass,"" ""Albert in Wonderland,"" and ""Albertross."" Then there was ""Albert Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest,"" ""Albert the Space Odessy "" (that was a big one). ""Albert Tatlock."" And a big hit for him came in a big sexual novel he wrote called ""Danish Albert on the Job."" 

That was a very big one for Albert which leads us very nicely and smoothly to our next piece of music, which hasn't got much to do with Albert at all. It is in fact some music from the album called Duke which we have called for the purposes of tonight's performance, ""Music from the Album Called Duke.""

Inspired by the likes of The Beatles, Paul Simon, Missippi John Hurt, Nirvana, and Bowie among others. 

Part 1 - The band introduce, talk about song writing, and perform their new reggae track, Chemistry Set, as well as their 50‚Äôs influenced tale of a beaten wife, Doo What. 
Listen out for the lyrics in Chemistry Set - beautifully simple, ‚ÄúLike group 1 metals in a wet sink ‚Äì we‚Äôre volatile, volatile‚Ä¶but remember love in a test tube is worth the while ‚Äì worth the while‚Äù.

Brad A. Myers,"E-‚ÄêLearning Applications: Enhancing education and interaction for online communities of practice
Cheryl D. Seals, Auburn University

E-learning is becoming an increasingly important teaching and learning method in educational institutions to provide broader access to quality of courses in many disciplines. In this poster, I will describe a few computing applications that have been created improve the work practice of different populations (4-H, K-12 Teacher Education, introductory computer programming and mathematics). We design, develop and test applications to determine instructional potential and improve the design and interaction style, which improves the usability for a population with the goal of universal usability. We create educational applications that are used by communities of practice to support e-Learning and online education.

One of the projects, I will discuss in this poster is the Digital Badges project is to promote learning across many content areas in 4-H and across other communities and institutions. In order to accomplish the above said goal a means of supporting a badge system is needed. 4-H Digital Badges is a website which allows learners to earn badges through a cloud based content management system. In addition, there will be different levels of permissions for adult facilitators with different privileges to supervise the learning/earning process. Adult badges are under development and all users are provided a secure account, to access their badges and to earn new badges. The process of earning badges in the 4-H system will vary from automatic issuance upon completion of requirements specified for the badge to review and approval of work submitted as per the requirements of a badge. A Digital badge is an online record of achievements, such as completion of an exam based on a particular skill. An existing problem with e-learning is that inability to share resources directly on the Internet based on content being created in many different mediums. We are aiming to utilize Cloud Computing as potential solution to this problem by providing a sharable e-learning cloud platform. This helps people to personalize their online environments, which help customization based on their interest.

Project two is related to delivering foundational computer science courses, especially in K-12 education. While enrollment in high school STEM courses have increased substantially, the percentage of high school students who take Computer Science is lower now than it was decades ago. Outreach efforts have begun to overcome this gap. We are supporting The Beauty and Joy of Computing Project (funded by NSF CS10-K program) that aims to train 10000 computing teachers in computing across the United States. We are collaborating to build an educational platform with effective and engaging new high school curricula in computing and getting that curriculum into high school classrooms through digital simulations, video tutorials, and educational gaming application. This project hopes to encourage larger numbers of students to pursue careers.

Project three is Spectrum Educational Consulting and with this application we have build online educational simulations to support pre-‚Äêservice teacher trainers. This application is used in the classroom to reinforce classroom management practices for undergraduate teacher education students.

Q: Please tell us a bit about yourself and your career path over the years; what ultimately led you to investigating questions of early embryonic development in zebrafish?

01:14 
Q: Can you explain a little about the importance of model organisms in regenerative research?

02:54
Q: Can you make that link between model organisms and humans? 

04:08
Q: Can you talk about the pro-regenerative signals carried out in response to injury during the blastema formation and why those are critical in regeneration?

06:14
Q: So, as the limb regenerates, when does it sort of gain sensory function? 

07:58
Q: How does the wound environment itself play a critical role in regeneration?

10:29
Q: So what's unique about the nail bed?

10:56
Q: So now, can you contrast that with what you are seeing in the axolotl limb regenerate? 

13:50
Q: what is the role of of stem cells be in the axolotl limb?

14:39
Q: Can you just briefly touch on what makes a cell have positional memory and why some cells do and do not? And what it is?

16:32
Q: Why do some cells not retain positional memory?

18:07
Q: Do you have any sense of what's governing the decision for periskeletal cells to either stay as connective tissue or lose their memory skeletal cells?

19:02
Q: What is the role of evolution in terms of regenerative capacity across different species?

12:04
Q: Do you think that regeneration is just an extension of embryogenesis in a way?

21:08
Q: So how similar are the mechanisms governing the regenerate to a developing structure?

23:04
Q: What do you mean by integration?

23:43
Q: What is the real timing of innervation of a developing limb? And where those nerves are relative to what's happening in regenerate?

24:39
Q: Has anybody looked at if you have a wound and you innervate it and the blastema forms. Has anybody tried disrupting the nerve after that? And seeing once the blastema forms, in response to innervation, if you can take away the nerve and everything will proceed normally?

25:56
Q: Current understanding of epigenetic influences on regeneration

28:40
Q: And what are those genes?

29:59
Q: I'm wondering if you can elaborate a little bit more on the pattern of Hox genes as a role for cell memory. 

31:20
Q: Could they be getting their memory via mechanisms of epigenetic regulation around the Hox genes that simply move from 3' to 5'?

33:04
Q: Is there any data out there to suggest that it's alterations in the epigenetics stage?

33:45
Q: Where is research in regeneration is going?

38:03
Q: Do axolotl form tumors?

38:44
Q: So could you speculate what might be the effect of having these genes be up-regulated in the mammal?

40:07
Q: Can we connect this with the selection pressure over evolution to repress regeneration?

Paratrooper

I grew up in Havana, Cuba and had an uneventful, happy childhood and early adolescence until Fidel Castro came to power when I was 16 years old. I graduated from high school in June 1959 and afterwards, began to work in life insurance because the University of Havana, where I had hoped to enter in medical school, was closed. Very quickly, I became involved in relatively disorganized anti-Castro activities and at the suggestion of my friends, who felt that I was in imminent danger, my parents sent me out of Cuba late in the Fall of 1959. My parents stayed in Cuba at that time, but they arranged, through a friend, for me to get a job in London, England as a clerk in a life insurance company. They felt that I would be safer in England with less likelihood of returning to Cuba to get involved in the underground.

After ten months in England, I heard from friends that men were being recruited to train somewhere in Central America for an invasion of Cuba. I arrived to the training camps in Guatemala in September 1960 and shortly thereafter volunteered to join the paratroopers and I was in the first group that arrived to the new training base for the paratroopers. On April 17, 1961, I was dropped at Palpite with the A Company of the paratrooper battalion. Before the paratroopers were dropped, our plane was being shot at and this made the pilots have to drop us somewhere off the plan drop area. In addition, we were dropped without our supplies which were hastily dropped by the pilot in the swamps since the plane was being shot at from the ground. We had a brief encounter with militia men to take over the town and then set up to block the road to Playa Larga which was our objective. Unfortunately, we quickly ran out of ammunition and since there was no supply, when Castro‚Äôs tanks began to come, our company Commander, Tomas Cruz, ordered us to retreat since we had no bazooka projectiles to fight the tanks. We then intended to go towards Playa Larga through the swamps because the tanks were passing through the main road. Unfortunately, our radio did not work and we lost communication and essentially got lost in the swamps. The next day, Cruz asked for volunteers to try to find the way to Playa Larga and I volunteered to go together with the legendary veteran of WWII and Korea, Manuel Perez Garcia. He and I arrived in Playa Larga, but because Castro‚Äôs men were already in control and Battalion II had retreated towards Giron, we could not make contact with the second battalion and we returned towards the point where we had left the rest of our colleagues in Company A. Our intention was to go to Giron the next morning, since by the time we returned it was the middle of the night. By the next morning, it was obvious that the battle was lost. I went with my squad towards the swamps with the intention of getting to Havana, but we were surprised by Castro‚Äôs soldiers from the rear and most of my squad were taken prisoners with exception of myself and Rolando Otero. We escaped to the swamps and stayed there for 12 days until we were finally captured. Eventually I was released with the rest of the prisoners after the United States agreed to pay the ransom.

Since returning to the USA, I have become a physician and then I trained in Neurosurgery at Harvard University and the Massachusetts General Hospital. Eventually I became a Professor at Harvard and then the Chairman of Neurosurgery at the University of Minnesota. In 1995, I moved to Miami where I am now the Professor and Co-Chairman of Neurosurgery at the University of Miami.

Stephen Clark,"Language exhibits hierarchical structure, but recent work using a subject-verb agreement diagnostic argued that state-of-the-art language models, LSTMs, fail to learn long-range syntax sensitive dependencies. Using the same diagnostic, we show that, in fact, LSTMs do succeed in learning such dependencies‚Äîprovided they have enough capacity. We then explore whether models that have access to explicit syntactic information learn agreement more effectively, and how the way in which this structural information is incorporated into the model impacts performance. We find that the mere presence of syntactic information does not improve accuracy, but when model architecture is determined by syntax, number agreement is improved. Further, we find that the choice of how syntactic structure is built affects how well number agreement is learned: top-down construction outperforms left-corner and bottom-up variants in capturing non-local structural dependencies.","LSTMs Can Learn Syntax-Sensitive Dependencies Well, But Modeling Structure Makes Them Better",3abc5ffb1757ec3f35cb7b4100410570b0b51e09,LSTMs Can Learn Syntax-Sensitive Dependencies Well But Modeling Structure Makes Them Better,https://vimeo.com/285803729

After seeing the amazing work done by Angjoo Kanazawa, Michael J. Black, David W. Jacobs, Jitendra Malik on the End-to-end Recovery of Human Shape and Pose paper. I wanted to have a look if I could use OpenPose and HMR to implement a one click video to mocap solution. The script takes a video and outputs a separate maya file for each person in the video containing and animated HIK skeleton.

The HMR repository was slightly adjusted to work with python3 in a windows environment and matrices to be exported over multiple frames to support video. The number of joints exported by the HMR solution is insufficient to create a working HIK skeleton, a center hip and spine joint had to be estimated. The OpenPose util was updated to recognize the same person over multiple frames, and omit people if they are under a certain presence threshold.

For this demo the animation curves exported have been simplified to reduce initial jitter. As you can see it will not be a render ready solution but potentially a great tool to get an initial starting point or simply to be used as 3D reference.

Jon M. Kleinberg,"4/13/2011 - Computational Perspectives on Social Phenomena at Global Scales

With an increasing amount of social interaction taking place in the digital domain, and often in public online settings, we are accumulating enormous amounts of data about phenomena that were once essentially invisible to us: the collective behavior and social interactions of hundreds of millions of people, recorded at unprecedented levels of scale and resolution. Analyzing this data with powerful computational techniques offers a radically new perspective on fundamental questions in the social sciences: how is the collective attention of a population focused; how does social influence between people operate; and how do our social networks reconfigure as we interact with one another? Such developments are not just taking place at the level of large groups; as each of us accumulates large digital traces of our behavior, we also confront the prospect of software that ‚Äî at some level ‚Äî knows more about us than we know about ourselves.

Charlotte J. Patterson,"The video opens with some street vignettes, a performance by Japanese drummers Wasabi Daiko, and the entire parade, from start to finish. 

After the parade you'll see some sexy images, a set by Bitch Diva (with John Alcorn and Jana Reid), and an exciting performance by Shadowy Men on a Shadowy Planet.

The motto for Lesbian and Gay Pride Day, 1992, was ‚ÄúBreaking the Silences,‚Äù a phrase from West Indian lesbian poet Audre Lorde: ‚ÄúIt is not our difference that immobilizes us, but silence. And there are so many silences to be broken.‚Äù

1992 marked a year of firsts for Pride:

‚Ä¢ It was the first year when a whole week was devoted to Pride events (June 21‚Äì28).
‚Ä¢ June Rowlands was the first mayor of Toronto to officially proclaim Pride Day (the previous year, City Council overturned Art Eggleton‚Äôs refusal, so technically that year marked the first official city recognition of the event).
‚Ä¢ This was the first year when the parade took up both northbound and southbound lanes of Yonge Street.
‚Ä¢ The Church Street site was extended from Gloucester St in the north to Carlton St in the south, with stages at both ends.

According to Kathy O‚ÄôBrien of the Lesbian and Gay Pride Committee, one of the biggest changes in 1992‚Äôs Pride event ‚Äúwas an attempt to get away from making this a gay white males event. A lot more groups representing the whole community were consulted this year.‚Äù

The Grand Marshals for the 1992 parade were children of lesbian and gay parents.

The permanent AIDS memorial was slated to open for this year‚Äôs Pride but would not be complete until 1993.

Attendance estimates for 1992 ranged between 30,000 (from the Toronto Sun) and 100,000 (from the Pride Committee). Watching this video you‚Äôll see that Pride enjoyed a very healthy attendance in 1992.

Pride button and t-shirt design was by Pat O‚ÄôGorman and Murray Grondin.

Stanley J. Miller,"Guys, did you know that only 3 out of every 5 men get an annual physical‚Äîand 40% of you only go to the doctor when you think you have a serious medical condition? And unlike women, you‚Äôre far less likely to talk about your health. 

We‚Äôre here to change that.  

The first thing every man should do is have an annual checkup with his doctor. It‚Äôs the perfect time to check your BMI, get a baseline blood pressure and have blood tests to check cholesterol, blood sugar and other factors. The American Cancer Society also suggests that testicular exams should also be a part of your annual checkup, as about half of testicular cancer occurs guys ages 20 to 34. And finally, you‚Äôll want to be checked for any signs of skin cancer, as men are more likely than women to get non-melanoma basal cell and squamous cell skin cancers. 

Starting at age 50 (or earlier if recommended by your doctor) men should undergo a prostate cancer screening. Prostate cancer is the second most common form of cancer among men and early detection is important. Colon cancer screenings should also begin at or before age 50, with follow up exams determined by your healthcare provider.

Lucio Luzzatto,"Favism is a common genetic metabolism disorder that is linked to the Glucose-6-Phosphate Dehydrogenase (G6PD) enzyme. When individuals with G6PD deficiency consume fava beans, which contain a specific phytochemical, the result can be a hemolytic crisis that can vary from a mild to a severe reaction. This individual response variability is now understood to be due to the fact that multiple single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) are connected to G6PD deficiency. Genetic testing tools are now enabling researchers to interrogate SNP variability‚Äîand how it influences human function‚Äîat a level never before possible. PLMI President, Jeffrey Bland, PhD, explains why this type of testing will one day inform how to optimally personalize our diet, our lifestyle, and our environment.

Social relationships are linked to improved survival

Individuals with adequate social relationships have a 50% greater likelihood of survival compared to those with poor or insufficient social relationships. The magnitude of this effect is comparable with stopping smoking and exceeds many well known risk factors for mortality such as obesity and physical inactivity. These are the main findings of a meta-analysis of social relationships and mortality risk published in PLoS Medicine by researchers at Brigham Young University.

The authors' findings are derived from the identification and analysis of 148 studies that included data from 308,849 individuals who were followed up for an average of 7.5 years. Their analysis indicates that the overall effect remained consistent despite taking various factors, such as age, sex, initial health status, follow up period and cause of death, into account. This result suggests that the association between social relationships and mortality may be general, therefore, efforts to reduce risk should not be isolated to certain groups, such as older people.

Efforts to reduce mortality via enhancing social relationship factors will require innovation but any future social relationship-based interventions represent a major opportunity to enhance both survival and quality of life, say the authors.

The authors conclude that ""Physicians, health professionals, educators, and the public media take risk factors, such as smoking, diet, and exercise, seriously: the data presented here make a compelling case for social relationship factors to be added to that list.""

Tim R. Wheeler,"Climate Change and Food Security
Kiyoshi Takahashi the National Institute for Environmental Studies

Food production is one of the sectors that are most sensitive to the projected change in climate. In conjunction with other (mainly socioeconomic) factors such as production technology, population, and equity, in some regions or countries,change in crops yield due to climate change can be a major factor affecting the state of food security in future.

We have conducted simulation analyses of climate change impacts on global food security through the integrative use of a biophysical crops yield model and an economic global trade model.

Masutomi et al. (2009) analyzed rice productivity in Asia considering uncertainty in projection of future climate with a crops yield model called M-GAEZ. The results suggested the necessity of adaptation for compensating the projected inevitable near-term yield loss due to ongoing climate change as well as the necessity of mitigation for keeping the yield loss at the end of this century under control. Hasegawa et al. (2013) projected food consumption and risk of hunger globally through 2050 by combining the M-GAEZ and a computable general equilibrium (CGE) model. The study found that population and economic development had a greater impact than climate conditions for risk of hunger at least throughout 2050, but climate change was projected to have notable impacts,even in the strong emission mitigation scenarios.

At the JAFoS symposium, for the purpose of giving the background of the problem,first Iwill briefly introduce the summary of the latest scientific knowledge on climate change impacts on global food security based on the IPCC 5th assessment report published recently (IPCC,2014). Next,Iwill explain some examples of researches conducted in NIES regarding the global food security issues.

The central dogma of molecular biology held that DNA encodes RNA that in turn encodes proteins. Other factors key to cellular function and diversity are at play, such as epigenetics where gene expression patterns are controlled by molecular ‚Äúswitches‚Äù instead of DNA alone, exotic RNAs that do not encode proteins, and others. The contributions of these molecules to health or disease in individuals and cohorts of people is being defined though molecular epidemiology and population health studies that link so-called ‚Äòomics data to large medical imaging files, data from national health and death registry systems, electronic medical records, social networks and other systems.

Francis Crick,"In this video lecture, educator describes the Functional Organization of the Human Body. 60 per cent of the adult human body is fluid. Extracellular fluid contains large amounts of sodium, chloride, and bicarbonate ions plus nutrients for the cells, such as oxygen, glucose, fatty acids, and amino acids. Intracellular fluid differs significantly from the extracellular fluid; specifically, it contains large amounts of potassium, magnesium, and phosphate ions instead of the sodium and chloride ions found in the extracellular fluid.

Thousands of Genetic control systems, some operate within the organs to control functions of the individual part of the organs, other operate throughout the entire body to control the interrelations between the organ, Respiratory system, operating in association with the nervous system regulates CO2 in ECF, Liver and pancreas regulate the concentration of glucose in the extracellular fluid.

 Agene is a section of DNA that codes for a protein. Each unique gene has a unique sequence of bases. This unique sequence of bases will code to produce a unique protein. These proteins and combination of proteins that give us a unique phenotype. The central dogma of molecular biology deals with the detailed residue-by-residue transfer of sequential information. It states that information cannot be transferred back from protein to either protein or nucleic acid. In other words, 'once information gets into protein, it can't flow back to nucleic acid.

The central dogma of molecular biology describes the two-step process, transcription and translation, by which the information in genes flows into proteins. Proteins carry signal sequence/patch for their transport from cytoplasm to ER and from ER to Golgi and other organelles. Intracellular Secretory pathway leads outward from ER towards the Golgi Apparatus and Cell Surface, with a side route leading to lysosomes. Transport Vesicle bud off from one compartment and fuse with another. In doing so they carry material as cargo from the lumen and membrane of donor compartment to the lumen and membrane of the target compartment. Three well characterized coated Vesicles that differ in coat proteins are Clathrin Coated Vesicles, COP1 Coated Vesicles, and COP2 Coated Vesicles. Each type is used in different step in cell.

Omar M Yaghi,"Novel Materials for Energy Storage and Conversion
Jeffrey Long, University of California, Berkeley, USA

Recent advances in the synthesis and characterization of solids have led to significant improvements in our ability to tailor the properties of new materials for use in the conversion and storage of energy. Of particular interest are materials needed for the generation of electricity in a clean, sustainable fashion, and for the storage of energy in light-weight and compact forms. Important examples include materials that convert sunlight into electricity or into a fuel such as hydrogen,1 and that enable mobile applications via batteries2 or fuel cells.3,4
Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) provide a good example of how new approaches to chemical synthesis can lead to breakthrough materials with a variety of applications. Over the past decade, these compounds have emerged as a new class of porous solids exhibiting record surface areas of up to 5200 m2/g, as well as tunable pore sizes and surface chemistry.5-7 MOFs are typically crystalline powders obtained from a high-dielectric solvent by reaction of a metal salt with an organic bridging ligand capable of linking the metal cations into a porous three-dimensional network structure. Subsequent heating under vacuum evacuates the solvent molecules from the pores of the structure without destroying the network connectivity. Owing to their exceptionally high surface areas, these materials can exhibit tremendous capacities for compressed gas storage, delivering the highest known storage densities for methane, acetylene, carbon dioxide, and hydrogen. In particular, a great deal of research has focused on generating MOFs for possible use in the hydrogen storage systems of hydrogen fuel cell cars.8 A high surface area is also beneficial for a number of other potential applications, making these exceptional candidate materials for heterogeneous catalysis, drug delivery, and gas separations technology, such as carbon dioxide capture from power plant flue gas.7

Christos Simoglou,"General anesthesia with single-lung ventilation was always considered a condition for thoracoscopic major pulmonary resections. However ,non-intubated thoracoscopic lobectomy (with spontaneous ventilation) has been reported recently by using conventional video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS), epidural anesthesia and vagus blockade. Here we present the technique minimizing the invasiviness of the procedure even more: single incision VATS approach with no need for epidural or vagus blockade in a non-intubated patient.To our knowledge this procedure represents the less invasive approach to lobectomy.
A 86 year old woman with a 3.5 cm adenocarcinoma was proposed for a non intubated uniportal video-assisted thoracoscopic (VATS) surgery. The total surgical time was 80 minutes.

Christos Simoglou,"Video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS) is a minimally invasive surgical technique used to diagnose and treat problems in your chest.

During a video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery procedure, a tiny camera (thoracoscope) and surgical instruments are inserted into your chest through small incisions in your chest wall. The thoracoscope transmits images of the inside of your chest onto a video monitor, guiding the surgeon in performing the procedure.

Surgeons use the video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery technique to perform a variety of operations, such as:

Biopsy to diagnose lung cancer, mesothelioma and other chest cancers
Esophagus surgery (esophagectomy)
Hiatal hernia repair
Lung surgery, such as surgery to treat lung cancer and lung volume reduction surgery
Procedures to remove excess fluid or air from the area around the lungs
Surgery to relieve excessive sweating (hyperhidrosis)
Surgery to relieve gastroesophageal reflux disease

Tobias G√ºnther,"In recent years, much work was devoted to the design of light editing methods such as relighting and light path editing. So far, little work addressed the target-based manipulation and animation of caustics, for instance to a differently-shaped caustic, text or an image. The aim of this work is the animation of caustics by blending towards a given target irradiance distribution. This enables an artist to coherently change appearance and style of caustics, e.g., for marketing applications and visual effects. Generating a smooth animation is nontrivial, as photon density and caustic structure may change significantly. Our method is based on the efficient solution of a discrete assignment problem that incorporates constraints appropriate to make intermediate blends plausibly resemble caustics. The algorithm generates temporally coherent results that are rendered with stochastic progressive photon mapping. We demonstrate our system in a number of scenes and show blends as well as a key frame animation.

Abstract: After decades of digitization, large cultural heritage collections have emerged on the web, which contain massive stocks of content from galleries, libraries, archives, and museums. This increase in digital cultural heritage data promises new modes of analysis and increased levels of access for academic scholars and casual users alike. Going beyond the standard representations of search-centric and grid-based interfaces, a multitude of approaches has recently started to enable visual access to cultural collections, and to explore them as complex and comprehensive information spaces by the means of interactive visualizations. In contrast to conventional web interfaces, we witness a widening spectrum of innovative visualization types specially designed for rich collections from the cultural heritage sector. This new class of information visualizations gives rise to a notable diversity of interaction and representation techniques while lending currency and urgency to a discussion about principles such as serendipity, generosity, and criticality in connection with visualization design. With this survey, we review information visualization approaches to digital cultural heritage collections and reflect on the state of the art in techniques and design choices. We contextualize our survey with humanist perspectives on the field and point out opportunities for future research.",[VIS18 Preview] Visualization of Cultural Heritage Collection Data: State of the Art and Future Challenges (TVCG Paper),a2da15549de85111e64608060279c60e5c8def14,Visualization of Cultural Heritage Collection Data: State of the Art and Future Challenges.,https://vimeo.com/289789286

Il camminare fa parte di quelle azioni, o di quei movimenti che segnano un particolare momento di passaggio nella nostra infanzia e questo momento √® quello dell'imparare, dell'apprendere, del cominciare a. Questo significa che come infiniti altri movimenti e come anche nel linguaggio √® qualcosa che non possediamo dalla nascita, ma che in qualche modo iniziamo ad assumere da un certo momento in poi della nostra vita. Piuttosto che iniziare offrendo una possibile definizione di questo movimento √® cos√¨ che vi propongo di avvicinarvisi, come nell'infanzia e questo perch√© se da un lato √® pur vero che anche adesso √® possibile problematizzare la forma di abitudine che abbiamo assunto nel tempo nel camminare, dall'altro ci√≤ su cui oggi ci vogliamo soffermare √® l'apprendere a camminare nelle immagini-in-movimento.

C. Richard Chapman,"Defending the Earth with a Telescope: Mitigating Impact Hazard through Studies of Near-Earth Asteroids
Nicholas Moskovitz, Massachusetts Institute of Technology

An asteroid impact is the only natural catastrophe that we can accurately predict and attempt to mitigate. Fortunately, the odds of a large (km-scale) asteroid impacting the Earth are very small, and have almost entirely been eliminated thanks to efforts over the past decade to discover and track the largest asteroids in near-Earth space [1,2].  However, small (10‚Äòs to 100‚Äòs of meter) asteroids are far more numerous than their larger counterparts, are challenging to detect due to their small sizes and intrinsic faintness, and are not well understood in terms of their physical properties. Objects of this size can be dangerous as we saw with the impact of an approximately 15-meter object over Chelyabinsk, Russia in February 2013, an event that injured nearly 1000 people. 

Characterizing the basic physical properties of asteroids is essential to understanding and mitigating impact hazard. Properties like density, internal structure, size, rotation state, and morphology inÔ¨Çuence estimations for the frequency and severity of impact events [3]. Quite conveniently, these are exactly the same properties as those that areof interest for addressing fundamental science questions related to planet formation and evolution, meteoritics, gravitational dynamics, and radiative processes. 

I will discuss recent progress in our ability to telescopically characterize the physical properties of near-Earth asteroids. Recent advances have been driven by an exponentially increasing discovery rate of near-Earth asteroids over the past decade [4], which has and will continue to provide abundant opportunities for conducting a variety of novel investigations. I will highlight the types of observations that are used to characterize this population, the development of next-generation telescopic surveys that are allowing us to study objects down to a few meters in size within hours of discovery, and the unique research opportunities provided by those objects that Ô¨Çyby the Earth but narrowly avoid impact [5]. The study of near-Earth asteroids is a rapidly evolving Ô¨Åeld that in the coming years will yield new insights relevant to impact hazard while simultaneously providing information about the origin and evolution of small planetary bodies in the Solar System.

ABSTRACT: It remains challenging for information visualization novices to rapidly construct visualizations during exploratory data analysis. We conducted an exploratory laboratory study in which information visualization novices explored fictitious sales data by communicating visualization specifications to a human mediator, who rapidly constructed the visualizations using commercial visualization software. We found that three activities were central to the iterative visualization construction process: data attribute selection, visual template selection, and visual mapping specification. The major barriers faced by the participants were translating questions into data attributes, designing visual mappings, and interpreting the visualizations. Partial specification was common, and the participants used simple heuristics and preferred visualizations they were already familiar with, such as bar, line and pie charts. We derived abstract models from our observations that describe barriers in the data exploration process and uncovered how information visualization novices think about visualization specifications. Our findings support the need for tools that suggest potential visualizations and support iterative refinement, that provide explanations and help with learning, and that are tightly integrated into tool support for the overall visual analytics process.",How Information Visualization Novices Construct Visualizations,3ceca6a622553d55a8c38c376b20e7c7b7f2066f,How Information Visualization Novices Construct Visualizations,https://vimeo.com/76065433

Braden Hancock,"Training accurate classifiers requires many labels, but each label provides only limited information (one bit for binary classification). In this work, we propose BabbleLabble, a framework for training classifiers in which an annotator provides a natural language explanation for each labeling decision. A semantic parser converts these explanations into programmatic labeling functions that generate noisy labels for an arbitrary amount of unlabeled data, which is used to train a classifier. On three relation extraction tasks, we find that users are able to train classifiers with com-parable F1 scores from 5-100 faster by providing explanations instead of just labels. Furthermore, given the inherent imperfection of labeling functions, we find that a simple rule-based semantic parser suffices.",Training Classifiers with Natural Language Explanations,94f3b096ff2969aed0c6e0cae195d8fba27858cf,Training Classifiers with Natural Language Explanations,https://vimeo.com/285804886

Abstract: Soccer is one the most popular sports today and also very interesting from an scientific point of view. We present a system for analyzing high-frequency position-based soccer data at various levels of detail, allowing to interactively explore and analyze for movement features and game events. Our Visual Analytics method covers single-player, multi-player and event-based analytical views. Depending on the task the most promising features are semi-automatically selected, processed, and visualized. Our aim is to help soccer analysts in finding the most important and interesting events in a match. We present a flexible, modular, and expandable layer-based system allowing in-depth analysis. The integration of Visual Analytics techniques into the analysis process enables the analyst to find interesting events based on classification and allows, by a set of custom views, to communicate the found results. The feedback loop in the Visual Analytics pipeline helps to further improve the classification results. We evaluate our approach by investigating real-world soccer matches and collecting additional expert feedback. Several use cases and findings illustrate the capabilities of our approach.",Feature Driven Visual Analytics of Soccer Data,f328ed872812c9c51d6616cb15ed25e29da5529e,Feature-driven visual analytics of soccer data,https://vimeo.com/102599780

Michael Tomasello,"Michael Tomasello, of the Department of Developmental and Comparative Psychology at the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology, discusses his article for the 2013 Annual Review of Psychology, titled ""Origins of Human Cooperation and Morality."" In this video, he shares footage of chimpanzees and of toddlers collaborating, showing that while cooperation exists among other primates, it is much more developed in our societies, even among very young humans. Children have a stronger sense of egalitarianism, and do a better job of suppressing their self-interest when they cooperate on a task. Not only that, they are capable of demonstrating norm-based group-mindedness, another form of collaboration.

Eduardo Simoes Lopes Gastal,"We present a new approach for performing high-quality edge-preserving filtering of images and videos in real time. Our solution is based on a transform that defines an isometry between curves on the 2D image manifold in 5D and the real line. This transform preserves the geodesic distance between points on these curves, adaptively warping the input signal so that 1D edge-preserving filtering can be efficiently performed in linear time. We demonstrate three realizations of 1D edge-preserving filters, show how to produce high-quality 2D edge-preserving filters by iterating 1D-filtering operations, and empirically analyze the convergence of this process. Our approach has several desirable features: the use of 1D operations leads to considerable speedups over existing techniques and potential memory savings; its computational cost is not affected by the choice of the filter parameters; and it is the first edge-preserving filter to work on color images at arbitrary scales in real time, without resorting to subsampling or quantization. We demonstrate the versatility of our domain transform and edge-preserving filters on several real-time image and video processing tasks including edge-preserving filtering, depth-of-field effects, stylization, recoloring, colorization, detail enhancement, and tone mapping.",Domain Transform for Edge-Aware Image and Video Processing,2ad4b45b533cc8f02f51ea521183225dfeba70de,Domain transform for edge-aware image and video processing,https://vimeo.com/23225284

Strange Jealousy is mash up of warped sounds, acoustic instruments and synth sound design. Sounds and motifs flow in and out throughout the song, sometimes deliberately detuning, giving a feeling of uneasiness. This uneasiness links to the song‚Äôs emotion, the subject of which touches on family, love and its peripheries. This song has references to the aesthetics of trip-hop, jazz and Dub, with ‚Äúinstrumental inversion and ghostly voices, distant horn sections, odd perspectives, deep illusions and unexpected noises‚Äù [David Toop]. Perfecting this song came from the genius ears of Producer John Tonks, who has worked with many artists I admire from Tricky, to Massive Attack and Neneh Cherry.

The visuals of the video are generated algorithmically and feature visually complex patterns that emerge through the simulation of a self organizing behavioral system. Such patterns appear in nature and the brain is tuned to categorize them as organic, which also carries an inherited feeling of unease. This is used in the video as a vehicle to reflect on the emotions of the song. Taking the lead from the lyrics, the patterns evolve and shift between ambiguous  shapes to the recognizable form of the two faces, an elegant interplay between synthesis, metamorphosis and decomposition of organic patterns and the human figure.

The video was shot and edited as normal and then used to drive the behavior of a multi agent based system, obeying a set of simple rules and forces. The most characteristic behavior is the slime mold (Physarum Polycephalum) which creates a distinct network of interconnected branches. Over the years slime mold has fascinated many scientists and artists. Even though Physarum Polycephalum is a single cell organism, it exhibits a remarkable sensory-motor behavior and has the ability to create complex networks while searching for nutrients. Despite the lack of a central nervous system, it is able to effectively locate, migrate towards sources of food and over time optimize its complex network of interconnected branches, to effectively transport the nutrients over its constantly changing body.

The system was implemented in Touch Designer, with the core logic coded in GLSL with compute shaders and can also be performed in real time. Off-line motion vectors were extracted from the video using Furnace in Nuke.

We have done a short video about future food and when it has become accepted to eat insect, or in this case, worms. We think this is an interesting topic, since eating worms would be good for the environment. Worms contain a lot of protein and vitamins, which is both healthy and sustainable. By having a product at home which works like an ecosystem, the worms can be re-produced, and you grow your own protein at home, which makes the food as locally produced as possible. 

Similar things have been done in research before, where it has been shown that mealworms are a good protein source and should be considered to be used instead of other animal protein sources such as milk, chicken or beef (Oonincx, D. G., & De Boer, I. J., 2012). In some countries it is already accepted to eat insects (Vane-Wright, R. I., 1991). These earlier studies confirm that it is a good idea to eat insects such as mealworms as a protein source, and that it is more about acceptance. 

The aim with this movie is therefore to awoke discussions around the discourse of eating worms. Since it is not accepted in Sweden yet, we think it is time to start talking about those things. We already eat other animals and it is obvious that some animals are ok to eat and some are not. But why is it like that? 

The scope of the project is to show what it could look like when cooking a meal with worms. This makes it feel realistic and hopefully awoke some reactions. We decided to only go with worms, mostly because that is what has been done in earlier research and because of the time restrictions for this project.

verifier to efficiently check the integrity of the outsourced data without downloading the data. A key research challenge associated with
existing designs of data auditing protocols is the complexity in key management. In this paper, we seek to address the complex key
management challenge in cloud data integrity checking by introducing fuzzy identity-based auditing, the first in such an approach, to

About: There is today a great deal of controversy over digital and social media.  Even leaders in the tech industry are beginning to decry the time young people spend on smart phones and in social networks. To get at the ‚Äúreal‚Äù issues here, I want to start with the question: ‚ÄúWhat is a human being?‚Äù.  Over the last couple of decades, quite different areas of research have made significant discoveries about the ‚Äúnature‚Äù of human beings. This work, I believe, can give us a deeper understanding of digital and social media and more effective ways to harness them for good. The talk will be followed by a Q & A.

Ken A. Dill,"Ideas for Solving the Rest of the Protein Folding Problem
Lisa Lapidus, Michigan State University

Protein folding, the process by which an amino acid chain finds the stable structure integral to its function, has been a well-defined problem for more than 50 years but a predictive solution has continued to elude us.  It is clear that the physical interactions within the chain and with the surrounding water determines which structure has the lowest free energy but neither computation nor experiment can completely describe the path a protein might take to find it, in part because there is a huge range of timescales on which important folding events can occur.  Additionally, understanding protein folding in a cell also requires understanding folding while the chain is being synthesized and how folding competes with aggregation, which leads to diseases such as Parkinson‚Äôs and Alzheimer‚Äôs.  

There has undoubtedly been significant progress in understanding protein folding, in large part due to the tremendous advances in protein structure determination, but it is my view that this reliance on beautiful structures has limited our ability to understand how much disorder plays a role in this complex process.  I will discuss recent technical progress in experiment and computation to embrace this complexity in both folding and aggregation processes.

Lincoln-Reagan Dinner on the campus of Mars Hill College. 

CONGRESSIONAL DISRESPECT: 
What most Congressional members really think about their Constituents; by their actions and the verbal abuse they have demonstrated not very much! 

They actually believe this is a game and they are the key players. Before going any further let me submit to you, avoiding Town Hall Meetings to address Health Care, shows not only disrespect, but a lack of leadership. I would say to Mr. Shuler, our present Congressman to follow the advice of President Harry Truman. If you can't stand the heat, get out of the kitchen!

So they think it's a Game! 

Jake, likes to think of it as a game of Chess, mainly because they think of themselves as Knights in shinning armor, and their constituents as Pawns. So It's the Knights vs. Pawns. 

The Knights are under a misconception they honestly believe it was the Queen of The Medieval Times who dubbed the Knights. The political fact is it's the Pawns who now do the Dubbing; that's called the Today's Times. In the year of 2010 there will be lot's of New Knighting going on! 

The year 2010 is the year to take our Country back. And the so called Knights know it! they will fight and dirty it will get! However, when the votes are all counted the Pawns will prevail! Keep in mind.when the incumbent or candidate turns to dirty tactics, it's simply because they feel distraction is their only platform. 

Our Incumbent Congressman Heath Shuler (D) has launched his Re-Election web-site (11/16/09) asking the voters to return him to Congress, stating he wants to Keep Protecting our Mountain Values? He must be counting on the voters in District 11, who are not aware that he went into hiding rather then face his Constituents when they needed him at the Town Hall Meetings regarding the HealthCare questions they wanted answered! He was no where to be found.

However; I did notice he took the time to put on a hardhat and spend days out on I-40 after a rock-slide for his 
photo-op. (as he shows on his website)

Ask yourself; Do we really need a Congressman who only wants to be their for us when he needs Our Vote? 

Warm Regards,
James Jake Howard - Candidate for U.S. Congress District 11(Western North Carolina)

Juan Ruiz-Manzano,"Steve Lawn was a professor of Infectious Diseases and Tropical Medicine at the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine and at the Desmond Tutu HIV Centre, University of Cape Town. He had previously at Hospital for Tropical Disease and St Georges London, as well as Kumasi, Ghana and CDC, Atlanta. He died on 23rd September 2016 at the age of 50 years. This film is of his Memorial service on 7th October 2016, at St Stephen‚Äôs Church, East Twickenham attended by over 200 people.

Steve was a runner of marathons and ultra-marathons and the service was based on the theme of a race, with three scenes:

1. Yorkshireman in the Making

2. Nottingham Medical School and Marriage

3. Scientific Safaris on Tuberculosis and AIDS

Whilst Steve made major contributions to diagnosis and treatment of tuberculosis among people with AIDS, authoring over 250 publications and receiving many awards, the service focused more on why he did what he did. Steve's love of Africa was catalysed by a trans-Saharan expedition and he was passionate about improving health for the poorest. Whilst focused, his work was underpinned by his strong but quiet faith, an irrepressible sense of humour and a strong sense of adventure - crossing the Sahara, climbing Kilimanjaro, moving continents six times with his wife Joy and family. He took risks to have impact for the poorest and to invest in next generation of scientists.

Steve packed so much into his 50 years, as one senior colleague said we can only imagine what may have been if he had a complete working life span. To continue his legacy for TB/HIV of communicating science and the next generation of science leaders, the family with London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine, UCT/Desmond Tutu HIV Centre and the Union Against TB and Lung Disease, have established the STEVE LAWN MEMORIAL FUND. Even small amounts will add up to make a big difference. There will be a memorial lecture in March each year in London and Cape Town, with more information available from the TB Centre at LSHTM.

Kari B√∏,"Show Notes by Elaine Stevenson from Myotherapy Reading Room

Gr√°inne Donnelly¬†is an NHS Specialist Physiotherapist, in Pelvic, Obstetric and Gynaecological Physiotherapy.¬†¬†¬†She has a particular interest in the assessment and treatment of diastasis recti.

The word diastasis has an unfortunate tendency to strike fear into pregnant and post-natal women, and their clinicians alike, much of it unjustified.


Themes covered in the discussion included:

why diastasis is such a feared condition
relationship between fear and misinformation¬†
a review of the anatomy of the affected tissues
common referral pathways, including self-referral
when treatment is required
differentiating between functional vs problematic
physical strategies used in treatment: breathing, abdominal wall control, pelvic floor function and exercises
the importance of seeing a pelvic health physio before returning to high intensity exercise, eg running, for all women
the role social media plays in driving unrealistic expectations
training of the rectus abdominus and address atrophy
navigating the confusion created by conflicting opinions and perspectives of the health and fitness professions
the importance of language and lessons from our understandings about pain
appearance (‚Äòmummy tummy‚Äô), strength and function
need for education of health professionals re role of women‚Äôs health physiotherapists in the management of this condition
links to low back pain, urinary incontinence, pelvic floor function and pelvic organ prolapse
measurement issues: size of gap vs strength
importance of setting meaningful goals and getting back into sport and activities (ie moving away from ‚Äòcan‚Äôt do‚Äô cultures)
pathways, physio rehab, referral into surgery, rehab post surgery (where surgery required)
strategies that affected women use to cope with diastasis
the importance of seeking help between pregnancies, as opposed to waiting until you‚Äôve finished your family

M. Nelly Golarz de Bourne,"What is the best way to treat ""tight muscles""?

Patients often report a sensation of tightness and pain in muscles such as their upper trapezius. Should you reach straight for the massage cream or needles? Is there a better/longer term solution to help improve your patients ""tight and sore"" muscles?

In a recent BJSM study, Bourne et al. (2016) studied the effect of eccentric and concentric/eccentric strengthening exercises on hamstring fascicle length, assessed by 2D ultrasound.  30 males were allocated to one of three groups: 1. Nordic hamstring exercises (eccentric only), 2. 45 degree hip extension (concentric/eccentric), and 3. Controls (no exercise), and both active groups achieved a significant increase in fascicle length compared to controls.

Subjects performing eccentric or concentric/eccentric exercises achieved an increase in fascicle length at Week 5, Week 10, and following the intervention, along with increases in muscle strength and hypertrophy. 

This study suggests that we may be able to use strengthening to achieve increases in muscle fascicle length. Extrapolation of these results to patients with pain or pathology is not always clear cut (or even possible), and will be patient dependant, however, for muscles that feel tight, we may be able to perform strengthening instead of soft tissue techniques. 

Bourne et al (2016) assessed fascicle length in hamstrings. While the effect of strengthening on trapezius fascicle length has not been assessed to date, the effects of strength training on muscle strength are well documented (3). Thus, we may be able to utilise this research, along with clinical reasoning and specific research on upper trapezius muscle activity to improve muscle strength, length, robustness and capacity to cope with the demands of daily life.

Cools et al (2015) identified that upper trapezius EMG levels are higher in shoulder shrugs with the arms overhead, with lower associated EMG levels in levator scapulae. Utilising exercises such as this may allow you to preferentially targets upper trapezius more than levator scapulae with your patients, addressing their strength, length and capacity issues.  

So should we use soft tissue release or strengthening for muscle tension? It is somewhat of a false dichotomy, as soft tissue release and joint mobilisation can be effective as a component in the treatment of various musculoskeletal conditions when clinically indicated, used in an evidence-informed way, and alongside education and exercise. There are a number of approaches to the same musculoskeletal conditions such as ""tight traps"", including strengthening, taping, soft tissue release, joint mobilisation, education cognitive functional therapy, etc etc and all have their place. However, the next time you reach for the massage cream to  perform soft tissue release on your patient's ""tight"" upper trapezius or other area, think of how you can ""strengthen to lengthen"" or incorporate strengthening into your program. You can create a sustainable approach to treating muscle tightness, achieve long term effects, and empower your patients while getting them strong.

We have done a short video about future food and when it has become accepted to eat insect, or in this case, worms. We think this is an interesting topic, since eating worms would be good for the environment. Worms contain a lot of protein and vitamins, which is both healthy and sustainable. By having a product at home which works like an ecosystem, the worms can be re-produced, and you grow your own protein at home, which makes the food as locally produced as possible. 

Similar things have been done in research before, where it has been shown that mealworms are a good protein source and should be considered to be used instead of other animal protein sources such as milk, chicken or beef (Oonincx, D. G., & De Boer, I. J., 2012). In some countries it is already accepted to eat insects (Vane-Wright, R. I., 1991). These earlier studies confirm that it is a good idea to eat insects such as mealworms as a protein source, and that it is more about acceptance. 

The aim with this movie is therefore to awoke discussions around the discourse of eating worms. Since it is not accepted in Sweden yet, we think it is time to start talking about those things. We already eat other animals and it is obvious that some animals are ok to eat and some are not. But why is it like that? 

The scope of the project is to show what it could look like when cooking a meal with worms. This makes it feel realistic and hopefully awoke some reactions. We decided to only go with worms, mostly because that is what has been done in earlier research and because of the time restrictions for this project.

About: There is today a great deal of controversy over digital and social media.  Even leaders in the tech industry are beginning to decry the time young people spend on smart phones and in social networks. To get at the ‚Äúreal‚Äù issues here, I want to start with the question: ‚ÄúWhat is a human being?‚Äù.  Over the last couple of decades, quite different areas of research have made significant discoveries about the ‚Äúnature‚Äù of human beings. This work, I believe, can give us a deeper understanding of digital and social media and more effective ways to harness them for good. The talk will be followed by a Q & A.

Andrew C. Singer,"Bioremediation of Pollutants 
Yongming LUO
(Institute of Soil Science, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Nanjing PR China)

This presentation gives general introduction of bioremediation of pollutants in the environment, with particular emphasis in recent research progresses and development trends in soil bioremediation of heavy metals, persistent organic pollutants and petroleum in China. Bioremediation generally covers phytoremedaiton and microbial remediation. Phytoremdiation including phytoextraction by using hyperaccumulating plants, phytomobilsation by ennery crops, phytovatilisation by genetically-modified genotypes has been adopted for decontamination of toxic metals in soils. Field demonstration shows significant removal of toxic metals such as As or Cd by using hyperaccumulators (e.g. Chinese brake fern or sedum alfredii). Microbial remediation including rhizo-remediation and myco-remediation by inoculation of effective fungi and bacteria has been mainly studied for degradation of persistent organic pollutants such as polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) in soil. In-situ and ex-situ bioremediation technologies have also been developed for cleanup of petroleum-contaminate soil. Natural attenuation has a remarkable reduction in chlorinated pesticides in agricultural soil. Hybrid remedaiton techniques are being studied for restoration of mixed polluted land. Future trends in bioremediation reserach and management in China should cover the following aspects:(1) more attention to phytomanagement of organic pollutants; (2) from empirical study to mechanistic study to obtain better understanding of underlying processes at a molecular level, (3) from laboratory simulation to real world situation for making bioremediation work in the field, (4) multidisciplinary study for further development, optimization, and site demonstration of biotechnology; and (5) enforcement of soil enviornmental risk assessment and quality standards and implementation of soil pollution prevention and remediation legislation.

M. Nelly Golarz de Bourne,"What is the best way to treat ""tight muscles""?

Patients often report a sensation of tightness and pain in muscles such as their upper trapezius. Should you reach straight for the massage cream or needles? Is there a better/longer term solution to help improve your patients ""tight and sore"" muscles?

In a recent BJSM study, Bourne et al. (2016) studied the effect of eccentric and concentric/eccentric strengthening exercises on hamstring fascicle length, assessed by 2D ultrasound.  30 males were allocated to one of three groups: 1. Nordic hamstring exercises (eccentric only), 2. 45 degree hip extension (concentric/eccentric), and 3. Controls (no exercise), and both active groups achieved a significant increase in fascicle length compared to controls.

Subjects performing eccentric or concentric/eccentric exercises achieved an increase in fascicle length at Week 5, Week 10, and following the intervention, along with increases in muscle strength and hypertrophy. 

This study suggests that we may be able to use strengthening to achieve increases in muscle fascicle length. Extrapolation of these results to patients with pain or pathology is not always clear cut (or even possible), and will be patient dependant, however, for muscles that feel tight, we may be able to perform strengthening instead of soft tissue techniques. 

Bourne et al (2016) assessed fascicle length in hamstrings. While the effect of strengthening on trapezius fascicle length has not been assessed to date, the effects of strength training on muscle strength are well documented (3). Thus, we may be able to utilise this research, along with clinical reasoning and specific research on upper trapezius muscle activity to improve muscle strength, length, robustness and capacity to cope with the demands of daily life.

Cools et al (2015) identified that upper trapezius EMG levels are higher in shoulder shrugs with the arms overhead, with lower associated EMG levels in levator scapulae. Utilising exercises such as this may allow you to preferentially targets upper trapezius more than levator scapulae with your patients, addressing their strength, length and capacity issues.  

So should we use soft tissue release or strengthening for muscle tension? It is somewhat of a false dichotomy, as soft tissue release and joint mobilisation can be effective as a component in the treatment of various musculoskeletal conditions when clinically indicated, used in an evidence-informed way, and alongside education and exercise. There are a number of approaches to the same musculoskeletal conditions such as ""tight traps"", including strengthening, taping, soft tissue release, joint mobilisation, education cognitive functional therapy, etc etc and all have their place. However, the next time you reach for the massage cream to  perform soft tissue release on your patient's ""tight"" upper trapezius or other area, think of how you can ""strengthen to lengthen"" or incorporate strengthening into your program. You can create a sustainable approach to treating muscle tightness, achieve long term effects, and empower your patients while getting them strong.

Sarah Piggett,"A documentation of SILVER LINING - a collection designed and crafted by Z√ñKITEE while taking part in Sew Blue 2014. 

Sew Blue is an initiative dedicated to using fashion to raise awareness about depression and mental illness in our community. With this years theme ""head up in the clouds"" Z√ñKITEE have designed a collection exploring the expression ‚ÄúEvery cloud has a silver lining‚Äù. The popular, inspirational proverb which emerged in the 1800‚Äôs after John Milton coined the term in a poem years earlier.

Muted tones and natural fibres were used in this collection to visually emulate the clouds, while the abundance of silver jewellery mimics the cloud's silver lining.

Many of the jewellery pieces were crafted especially for the event. However, rings, earrings and necklaces from their REFINE. REPEAT. collection can also be seen throughout.

Gordon V. Cormack,"If you are considering predictive coding but  feel overwhelmed by the hype and algorithms, we can help. Join us for a lively discussion comparing different approaches to defining seed sets, active and passive machine learning and refuting the idea that you need to use your most senior people to train the system. Using the results of a recent study, we will explain how these issues affect the time, cost and accuracy of integrating  TAR, AKA predictive coding into your review. 

Key topics for discussion: 

‚Ä¢       How the use of non-random selection to create seed sets improves accuracy and recall to jump start your review  
‚Ä¢       Why continuous active learning beats passive machine learning recall with less effort 
‚Ä¢       How to reserve your Sr. Attorneys for strategic calls maximizing their time on what‚Äôs really important
